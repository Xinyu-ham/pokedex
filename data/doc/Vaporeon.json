Vaporeon's body is light blue with a dark blue marking around its head and a spiky ridge down its spine. It has black eyes and a tiny black nose. There is a white fin encircling its neck and three fins with cream-colored webbing on its head. Two of these fins are on either side of its head, similar to ears; and one is directly on top of its head, resembling a dorsal fin. Vaporeon is a quadruped with three small toes on each foot and dark blue paw pads on the hind feet. Its split tail fin has been mistaken for a mermaid's in the past and is believed to be the origin of mermaid folklore. It can detect moisture with its fins, which vibrate when sensing incoming rain.\nVaporeon is mostly found in urban settings under the ownership of a Trainer. It is rarely seen in the wild, but it prefers clean freshwater lakes and shores. It has developed gills to become better suited to an aquatic lifestyle, and its cell composition's similarity to water allows it to melt into the water. This ability enables Vaporeon to remain camouflaged while swimming, hiding itself from enemies and allowing it to ambush its prey: fish Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n\nEvolution\nVaporeon evolves from Eevee.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nEevee\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nVaporeon\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #134\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nLives close to water.

No other Pok\u00e9mon in the series has this effect. The reason for this visual effect is unknown.\nVaporeon is the only Eeveelution that does not share any weakness with another Eeveelution.\nConcept and development\nVaporeon was designed by Atsuko Nishida.[1][2] Nishida originally designed Vaporeon to resemble a dog with fins on its legs but Ken Sugimori redesigned Vaporeon to resemble a cat and removed the fins.[1]\nIn Generation I, Vaporeon had a notably different design, with the backs of its ears being all black, fins on each leg, and a fin running down the entire length of its back, possibly remnants of its original dog-like design. All of these details were removed in Generation II. Notably, these details weren't present in its original Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green artwork.\n\n\n\n\n\nRed and Green sprite\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I back sprite\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed and Green art\n\n\n\n\nOrigin\nAccording to designer Atsuko Nishida, Vaporeon and especially its tail were designed with the idea of mermaids in mind.[1] It also resembles various aquatic creatures such as fish and dolphins. Its ears resemble a mix between a fish's fin and a fennec fox's ears.\nVaporeon may also be inspired by the Telchines of Greek mythology, or a pun on the catfish. Due to the fringe around its neck resembling a ruff and a lion's mane, Vaporeon may also be a possible reference to the heraldic sea-lion; or the similar-looking Merlion, a national symbol of Singapore. Its ability to become invisible and turn into water might be inspired by the Asrai. Vaporeon's resemblance to both carnivorans and cetaceans could be based on primitive whales, such as Kutchicetus.\n\nName origin\nVaporeon may be a combination of vapor and eon (an immeasurably long period of time, possibly referring to how long evolution takes naturally). Eon is a suffix all Eevee evolutions share and was Eevee's English prototype name.\nShowers is literally showers, referring to a bathroom shower or rain shower.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b7\u30e3\u30ef\u30fc\u30ba Showers\n\nFrom showers\n\n\n French\n\nAquali\n\nFrom aqua and -li (common suffix for all Eeveelutions in French)\n\n\n Spanish\n\nVaporeon\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nAquana\n\nFrom aqua and -a (common suffix for all Eeveelutions in German)\n\n\n Italian\n\nVaporeon\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc0e4\ubbf8\ub4dc Shamid\n\nFrom shower and mermaid\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u6c34\u4f0a\u5e03 Shu\u01d0y\u012bb\u00f9*\u6c34\u7cbe\u9748 / \u6c34\u7cbe\u7075 Shu\u01d0j\u012bngl\u00edng*\n\nFrom \u6c34 shu\u01d0 and \u4f0a\u5e03 Y\u012bb\u00f9From \u6c34 shu\u01d0 and \u7cbe\u9748 / \u7cbe\u7075 j\u012bngl\u00edng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u6c34\u4f0a\u5e03 S\u00e9uiy\u012bbou*\u6c34\u4f0a\u8c9d S\u00e9uiy\u012bbui*\n\nFrom \u6c34 s\u00e9ui and \u4f0a\u5e03 Y\u012bbouFrom \u6c34 s\u00e9ui and \u4f0a\u8c9d Y\u012bbui\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0928\u0940\u0930\u0940\u0935\u0940 Neereevee\n\nFrom \u0928\u0940\u0930 neer and Eevee\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0412\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043e\u043d Vaporeon\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e40\u0e27\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e2a Chaowoet\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nVee\nVaporeon (MPJ)\nReferences\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 (2018) EVs.
