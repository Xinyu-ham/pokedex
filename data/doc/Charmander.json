Its underside from the chest down and the soles of its feet are cream-colored. It has two small fangs visible in its upper jaw and two smaller fangs in its lower jaw. A fire burns at the tip of this Pok\u00e9mon's slender tail, which has blazed there since Charmander's birth.\nThe flame can indicate Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly when the Pok\u00e9mon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is said that Charmander would die if its flame were to go out. However, if the Pok\u00e9mon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the rain. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Charmander is known to sleep while curled up.[1] Supposedly, Charmander is drawing warmth from the flame on its tail. During quiet nights, one can hear the sound of a flame burning if you listen hard enough while Charmander sleeps.\nCharmander can be found in hot, mountainous areas. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. However, it is found far more often in Trainers ownership. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Snap and New Pok\u00e9mon Snap, Charmander exhibits pack behavior, calling others of its species if it finds food and watching the flames on each other's tails to ensure they don't go out.\n\n\nEvolution\nCharmander evolves into Charmeleon, which evolves into Charizard.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nCharmander\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nCharmeleon\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nCharizard\u00a0Fire\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9Park Wii: Pikachu's Adventure: Charmander is one of Pikachu's best friends. After falling through the mysterious tunnel, he almost lands into a pool of molten lava, only to be saved by the Lava Zone leader, Blaziken, who takes him in as his pupil and trains to become stronger. After he's been found, he journeys to the Meeting Place, where he helps Piplup mend the balloon and makes fireworks. He later accompanies Pikachu to the Sky Pavilion along with Piplup and Chikorita, where he meets Mew. Once the Sky Prism has been restored, Charmander celebrates by firing off the fireworks he made.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #004\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nObviously prefers hot places.

At first, Charmander refused to leave the spot he was at, believing Damian would return for him. However, when a rainstorm picked up, Charmander grew ill and Ash took him to a Pok\u00e9mon Center. Charmander eventually realized that Damian had been abusing him, and allowed Ash to catch him.

The spikes were not shown in the sprites and artwork of later generations. Blue's Charmander also had these spikes in the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga, where the spikes were larger and easier to see. The spikes were also seen on Green's Charmander from the Pok\u00e9mon Pocket Monsters manga.\nAdditionally, Charmander is depicted with an inconsistent number of fingers in its designs. The original sprites designed by Atsuko Nishida for Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green featured three fingers, while the artwork Ken Sugimori drew based on those sprites had four fingers. Currently, the TCG, animated series, movies, and specials, as well as artwork unrelated to games and merchandise, use the three-fingered hand design; while the 3D models and the artwork based on those (such as artwork for Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!) feature the four-fingered hand design.\n\n\n\n\n\nRed and Green sprite\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I back sprite\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXY series art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate art\n\n\n\n\nOrigin\n  Bulbanews has an article related to this subject: On the Origin of Species: Charmander  \nCharmander's design was based on Charizard in such a way that it was surprising to see it evolving into the latter Pok\u00e9mon.[2] In particular, Charmander was designed as a lizard.[2] Based on its name, Charmander is also based on a salamander, which are amphibians that physically resemble lizards. In folklore and mythology, salamanders are often thought of as fire spirits capable of surviving in extreme heat or flames. As Charizard is based on a European dragon, Charmander's lizardlike design seems to reference how Western dragons in folklore are heavily inspired by lizards and other reptiles, as well as how various types of lizards are likened to (and named after) dragons due to this connection. Its bipedal design resembles a baby theropod dinosaur.\n\nName origin\nCharmander is a combination of char (to burn) and salamander, as stated in the January 1999 \"POCKEMON JOURNAL\" on the official Game Freak website.[3] Alternatively, in a 2016 interview with Tsunekazu Ishihara by INSIDE, Charmander is stated to be a combination of charcoal (carbon residue produced by strongly heating wood) and Salamandra (a genus of salamander including four species of fire salamander).[4]\nHitokage may be a combination of \u706b hi (fire) and \u8725\u8734 tokage (lizard), forming together the word \u706b\u8725\u8734 hitokage (mythical salamander).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30d2\u30c8\u30ab\u30b2 Hitokage\n\nFrom \u706b hi, \u8725\u8734 tokage, and \u706b\u8725\u8734 hitokage\n\n\n French\n\nSalam\u00e8che\n\nFrom salamandre and m\u00e8che\n\n\n Spanish\n\nCharmander\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nGlumanda\n\nFrom Glut and Salamander\n\n\n Italian\n\nCharmander\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ud30c\uc774\ub9ac Fairi\n\nFrom fire and \uaf2c\ub9ac kkori\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5c0f\u706b\u9f8d / \u5c0f\u706b\u9f99 Xi\u01ceoh\u01d4ol\u00f3ng\n\nFrom \u5c0f xi\u01ceo, \u706b hu\u01d2, and \u9f8d / \u9f99 l\u00f3ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5c0f\u706b\u9f8d S\u00eduf\u00f3l\u00f9hng\n\nFrom \u5c0f s\u00edu, \u706b f\u00f3, and \u9f8d l\u00f9hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Arabic\n\n\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0645\u0646\u062f\u0631 Charmander\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Bulgarian\n\n\u0427\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u044a\u0440 Charmand\u016dr\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05e6'\u05e8\u05de\u05e0\u05d3\u05e8 Charmander\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u091a\u093e\u0930\u092e\u0948\u0902\u0921\u0930 Charmander\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\n\u017davingasis\n\nFrom English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0427\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440 Charmander\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e2e\u0e34\u0e42\u0e15\u0e04\u0e32\u0e40\u0e07\u0e30 Hitokha-nge\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\n\nAsh's Charmander\nRed's Charmander\nBlue's Charmander\nSalam\u00e8\nZippo\nCharla\nAlain's Charmander\nTrevor's Charmander\nLeon's Charmander\nSatoshi's Charmander (Zensho)\nPeanut's Charmander\nMandy (MPJ)\nGreen's Charmander\nCharizard (UNITE)\nTeam Go-Getters\nFirst partner Pok\u00e9mon\nPartner Pok\u00e9mon (Mystery Dungeon)\n\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 Creator Profile: The Creators of Pikachu - Pokemon.com (archived)\n\n\u2191 GAME FREAK | POCKEMON JOURNAL (archive)\n\n\u2191 (February 27, 2016). \"\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u304c\u73fe\u5b9f\u4e16\u754c\u3068\u4eee\u60f3\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u7e4b\u3044\u3067\u3044\u304f\u300120\u5e74\u76ee\u306e\u6311\u6226\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u4ee3\u8868\u53d6\u7de0\u5f79\u793e\u9577\u30fb\u77f3\u539f\u6052\u548c\u6c0f\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\" inside-games.jp.\n\n\nExternal links\nArticle on Wikipedia\n\n\n\nFirst partner trios\n\n\nKanto\n\nBulbasaur\nCharmander\nSquirtle\n\n\n\nJohto\n\nChikorita\nCyndaquil\nTotodile\n\n\n\nHoenn\n\nTreecko\nTorchic\nMudkip\n\n\n\nSinnoh\n\nTurtwig\nChimchar\nPiplup\n\n\n\nUnova\n\nSnivy\nTepig\nOshawott\n\n\n\nKalos\n\nChespin\nFennekin\nFroakie\n\n\n\nAlola\n\nRowlet\nLitten\nPopplio\n\n\n\nGalar\n\nGrookey\nScorbunny\nSobble\n\n\n\nPaldea\n\nSprigatito\nFuecoco\nQuaxly\n\n\n\nSee also: List of the player's first Pok\u00e9mon \u2022 Pikachu (Yellow) \u2022 Partner Pok\u00e9mon (LGPE) \u2022 Hisui first partner Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Smash Bros. series\n\n\nGames:\n\nSuper Smash Bros. \u2022 Super Smash Bros.
