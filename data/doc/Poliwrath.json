It has bulbous eyes that protrude from the top of its head and its belly is covered by a white and black swirl. There appear to be white gloves on its hands, and it has rounded, digit-less feet.\nPoliwrath's body is almost entirely muscle, and the muscles in its arms and legs never tire. It also has zero percent body-fat. When it swims, it uses all of the muscles in its body and is able to swim vast distances with minimal breathing. It is even capable of briefly running on the water's surface. It can also smash through ice and plow forward using its strong arms. Poliwrath is capable of out-swimming even world-class swimmers. Poliwrath is also skilled at martial arts. It can launch powerful square punches capable of crushing boulders into dust. Many children learn how to swim by replicating Poliwrath's movement. It is one of the most gifted swimmers of all Water-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nBeing the result of an evolution via Evolution stone, Poliwrath is rarely found in the wild. When found, it is usually seen living on dry land near the water's edge, despite it being an excellent swimmer. In Alola, Poliwrath found are strong enough to use the breaststroke while swimming.\n\nEvolution\nPoliwrath evolves from Poliwhirl and is one of the final forms of Poliwag, the other being Politoed.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nPoliwag\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPoliwhirl\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nPoliwrath\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Super Mystery Dungeon: Three Poliwrath brothers, along with a Poliwag, appear as the bosses of Poliwrath River.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #062\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nAn adept swimmer at both the front crawl and breast stroke.

Although the Pok\u00e9mon he was thinking of is most likely Politoed, it is too late, as it is Poliwhirl, not Poliwrath, that evolves into Politoed when traded while holding a King's Rock.\nAn early design of Poliwrath revealed on Game Freak's official Japanese website circa 1997 depicts it wearing a crown, similar to the King's Rock, which is necessary to evolve Poliwhirl into Politoed.\nPoliwrath shares its category with Poliwag, Poliwhirl, and Tympole. They are all known as the Tadpole Pok\u00e9mon.\nIn some illustrations, Poliwrath is depicted with four fingers instead of three.\nPrior to Generation VI, Poliwrath and its evolutionary counterpart Politoed shared the same base stat total. This changed in Generation VI when Poliwrath received a ten-point increase to its Attack, but Politoed did not receive a stat increase. It shares this counterpart difference with Beautifly.\nOrigin\nPoliwrath may be based on a tadpole and a frog. The spiral pattern on its belly is supposed to represent how the organs of tadpoles can sometimes be seen through their transparent skin. It may also be based on amphibian neoteny, as it stays in tadpole form and does not metamorphose into a frog.\nIts brawny body and newfound Fighting-type could be an interpretation of mature frogs' bulky bodies and vastly heightened muscle mass and strength in comparison to the tadpole. It might also be a reference to the physical prowess of swimming athletes.\n\nName origin\nPoliwrath may be a combination of polliwog (outdated term for tadpole) and wrath.\nNyorobon may be a combination of \u30cb\u30e7\u30ed\u30cb\u30e7\u30ed nyoronyoro (onomatopoeia for wriggling) and \u574a bon (boy).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30cb\u30e7\u30ed\u30dc\u30f3 Nyorobon\n\nFrom \u30cb\u30e7\u30ed\u30cb\u30e7\u30ed nyoronyoro and \u574a bon\n\n\n French\n\nTartard\n\nFrom Tartares, tarte and t\u00eatard\n\n\n Spanish\n\nPoliwrath\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nQuappo\n\nFrom Kaulquappe\n\n\n Italian\n\nPoliwrath\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uac15\ucc59\uc774 Gangchaengi\n\nFrom \uac15 (\u6c5f) gang or \uac15 (\u5f37) gang and \uc62c\ucc59\uc774 olchaeng-i\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u868a\u9999\u6cf3\u58eb W\u00e9nxi\u0101ngy\u01d2ngsh\u00ec*\u5feb\u6cf3\u86d9 Ku\u00e0iy\u01d2ngw\u0101*\n\nFrom \u868a\u9999 w\u00e9nxi\u0101ng, \u6cf3 y\u01d2ng, and \u52c7\u58eb y\u01d2ngsh\u00ecFrom \u5feb ku\u00e0i, \u6cf3 y\u01d2ng, and \u86d9 w\u0101\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u868a\u9999\u6cf3\u58eb M\u0101nh\u0113ungwihngsih*\u5927\u529b\u86d9 Daaihlihkw\u0101*\n\nFrom \u868a\u9999 m\u0101nh\u0113ung, \u6cf3 wihng, and \u52c7\u58eb y\u00fahngsihFrom \u5927\u529b daaihlihk and \u86d9 w\u0101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092c\u0948\u0902\u0917\u091a\u093f\u092c\u0949\u0938 Bangchiboss\n\nFrom \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0917/\u092c\u0947\u0901\u0917 bang and boss\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nPolivratas\n\nFrom English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442 Polivrat\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e40\u0e19\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e42\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e19 Niaorobon\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nPoli\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0061: Poliwhirl\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0063: Abra\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Poliwrath_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4129096\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monWater-type Pok\u00e9monFighting-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Slow experience groupBlue-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 12 Pok\u00e9monWater 1 group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kitakami Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 500Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 510Pok\u00e9mon with 18 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monShadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XDF.E.A.R.-compatible Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon whose base stats changed in Generation VI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 22:21.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
