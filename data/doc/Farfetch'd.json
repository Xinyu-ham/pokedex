It has a flat, yellow beak, brown eyes, a V-shaped black marking on its forehead (similar to a unibrow), and a three-feather crest on top of its head. Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be prehensile enough to substitute for hands. It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail.\nFarfetch'd is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion. It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead. Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch'd will defend it with its life. Losing the stalk can leave Farfetch'd defenseless, and it will seek out a new one to replace it. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. When using the stalk to attack, Farfetch'd wields and uses it like a sword to cut through things. There are several different fighting styles involving Farfetch'd's leek. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. Farfetch'd is found in temperate grasslands where reedy plants grow, guarding the plants from anyone trying to disturb them. However, Farfetch'd is rarely seen, and thus it is thought that its numbers are decreasing, and that it is at risk of extinction. According to sources such as Pok\u00e9mon the Series and the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, its population decline is caused by humans who hunted it down for food; one popular recipe suggested cooking it with its own leek. There have been attempts at breeding in order to increase the Farfetch'd population. In the Pikachu short Pikachu's Vacation, Farfetch'd are shown to be able to swim like real-life ducks.\nFarfetch'd and Sirfetch'd are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Leek item.\n\nForms\nFarfetch'd has a regional form: Galarian Farfetch'd.\nIn Galar, Farfetch'd is a deeper shade of brown, with a more prominent black mark on its head and a much more unfriendly look on its face. The leek it carries with its wings is much larger in Galar than the leeks that Farfetch'd use in other regions, although whether it is related to the Large Leek used as a curry ingredient is unknown.\nGalarian Farfetch'd's body has developed a much stronger frame that gives it the strength required to carry its leek. However, this sheer mass makes it hard for it to fly. It is renowned for its courage in battle and can use its leek like swords or javelins. As a result of surviving and experiencing many different battles, Galarian Farfetch'd develops the ability to evolve into Sirfetch'd.\n\nEvolution\nGalarian Farfetch'd evolves into Sirfetch'd. Kantonian Farfetch'd is not known to evolve into or from any other Pok\u00e9mon.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nGalarian Farfetch'd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nFarfetch'dGalarian Form\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nSirfetch'd\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nGold, Silver, and Crystal: The charcoal makers of Azalea Town own a Farfetch'd. However, it won't listen to the apprentice and runs off in the Ilex Forest. Herding it back to him earns the player an HM01 (Cut).\nPok\u00e9mon Super Mystery Dungeon: Farfetch'd is one of the teachers at the school in Serene Village. He is serious about what he does, but his lessons are frequently interrupted. During summer vacation, he goes missing due to some mischievous ghosts, but he is returned without being harmed.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #083\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nThe sprig of green onions it holds is its weapon.

their Kantonian counterpart from Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!. Galarian Farfetch'd or Sirfetch'd in Pok\u00e9mon HOME, Sword, or Shield with illegal moves had their moves replaced with moves from their level-up movepool on November 16, 2020; opening Pok\u00e9mon HOME at any point after that date will cause HOME to search all Sword and Shield savefiles on the console and correct the illegal movesets.\nPlayers who transferred a Galarian Farfetch'd with any of these illegal moves cannot trade or battle online with it unless that move is deleted. These erroneous Galarian Farfetch'd otherwise function like other Galarian Farfetch'd, with Galarian Farfetch'd from GO being able to evolve into a Sirfetch'd with an illegal

Ultimate\nFarfetch'd appears as a Spirit.\n\nTrivia\n Sprite of Mad\u0101mu from 1997 demo\nIn the 1997 Nintendo Space World demo of Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver, Farfetch'd had an evolution, known as \u30de\u30c0\u30fc\u30e0 Mad\u0101mu, that was scrapped in the final release of the games.\nPok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield director Shigeru Ohmori has stated in an interview that Sirfetch'd's design is not inspired by this scrapped evolution, but is instead a new one fitting for the Galar region, which is based on the United Kingdom.[1]\nFarfetch'd and Sirfetch'd are the only Pok\u00e9mon with an apostrophe in their names.\nDue to this, it is impossible to return a nicknamed Farfetch'd to its species name in the English, Spanish, or Italian versions of the Generation I and II games. This is because the apostrophe is not available as a character for nicknames.\nDue to a bug in Pok\u00e9mon HOME, an unnicknamed Farfetch'd or Sirfetch'd with an English, Spanish, or Italian language of origin that is transferred into HOME will be treated as a nicknamed Pok\u00e9mon, due to HOME assigning a different character for the apostrophe in the species names (\"Farfetch\u2019d\" and \"Sirfetch\u2019d\").\nFarfetch'd is the only Pok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 377. Prior to the Attack increase it received in Pok\u00e9mon X and Y, it was instead the only Pok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 352.\nDue to changes to the critical-hit formula in Generation VI, if Farfetch'd holds its signature item, the Leek, and uses a move with an increased critical-hit ratio, the move will always land as a critical hit.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Emerald, Farfetch'd can learn Fury Cutter via leveling up, but not via Move Tutor. This was fixed in Platinum.\nGalarian Farfetch'd can be seen as a parallel to Galarian Corsola. They are both regional forms with a single type and can evolve once, while their original forms do not evolve. At the Stow-on-Side Stadium and during the Champion Cup Finals, Bea in Pok\u00e9mon Sword uses Galarian Farfetch'd's evolution, Sirfetch'd, in her team, while Allister in Pok\u00e9mon Shield uses Galarian Corsola's evolution, Cursola, in his team.\nGalarian Farfetch'd was released in Pok\u00e9mon GO on June 17, 2020, shortly after Galarian Meowth and Zigzagoon. Although the latter two could evolve into Perrserker and Obstagoon upon release, respectively, Galarian Farfetch'd couldn't evolve into Sirfetch'd at the time. Sirfetch'd was later added to coincide with the release of The Crown Tundra for the Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield Expansion Pass on October 22, 2020.\nWild Galarian Farfetch'd will not evolve if it lands three critical hits on the player's Pok\u00e9mon and is then caught.[2]\nOrigin\n  Bulbanews has an article related to this subject: On the Origin of Species: Farfetch'd  \nFarfetch'd seems to be based on a duck. It may be inspired by the Japanese saying \u300c\u9d28\u304c\u8471\u3092\u80cc\u8ca0\u3063\u3066\u6765\u308b\u300d, literally translating to \"a duck comes bearing spring onions\". As a saying, it means \"easy target\" or \"golden opportunity\". The phrase can be shortened to \u300c\u9d28\u8471\u300d, which is transliterated the same as Farfetch'd's Japanese name (Kamonegi).\nGalarian Farfetch'd was inspired by leeks in the United Kingdom growing larger and thicker than leeks in Japan.[3] The leek it carries resembles the Giant Musselburgh, a larger variant of the spring onion that was first bred in Scotland, and the wild leek, one of the national symbols of Wales. Galarian Farfetch'd itself may be inspired by a hammer throw athlete given the way it wields its leek, such as swinging it in a circular motion during its attacks. It may also be based on a javelin thrower. Its serious disposition and how it holds its leek over its shoulder is typical of the lone samurai archetype in modern Japanese fiction; the leek thus could be a stand-in for the \u014ddachi, which are large traditional Japanese swords such that samurai carrying them had to haul them over their backs.\n\nName origin\nFarfetch'd may be derived from far-fetched, meaning unbelievable, perhaps relating to Farfetch'd's rarity or the \"far-fetched\" theme of its Japanese name.\nKamonegi may be a combination of \u9d28 kamo (duck) and \u8471 negi (spring onion) that forms the expression \u9d28\u8471 kamo negi, an abbreviation of the proverb \u300c\u9d28\u304c\u8471\u3092\u80cc\u8ca0\u3063\u3066\u6765\u308b\u300d kamo ga negi o shottekuru (literally \"a duck comes bearing spring onions\") that means \"easy target\" or \"golden opportunity\".\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30ab\u30e2\u30cd\u30ae Kamonegi\n\nFrom \u9d28 kamo and \u8471 negi, as well as the expression \u9d28\u8471 kamo negi\n\n\n French\n\nCanarticho\n\nFrom canard and artichaut\n\n\n Spanish\n\nFarfetch'd\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nPorenta\n\nFrom Porree and Ente\n\n\n Italian\n\nFarfetch'd\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ud30c\uc624\ub9ac Paori\n\nFrom \ud30c pa and \uc624\ub9ac ori\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5927\u8525\u9d28 / \u5927\u8471\u9e2d D\u00e0c\u014dngy\u0101\n\nFrom \u5927\u8525 / \u5927\u8471 d\u00e0c\u014dng and \u9d28 / \u9e2d y\u0101\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5927\u8525\u9d28 Daaihch\u016bng'aap*\u706b\u8525\u9d28 F\u00f3ch\u016bng'aap*\n\nFrom \u5927\u8525 daaihch\u016bng and \u9d28 aapFrom \u706b\u8525 f\u00f3ch\u016bng and \u9d28 aap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092b\u093c\u093e\u0930\u092b\u093c\u0947\u091a Farfetch\n\nSimilar to English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0424\u0430\u0440\u0444\u0435\u0442\u0447\u0434 Farfetchd\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e04\u0e32\u0e42\u0e21\u0e40\u0e19\u0e01\u0e34 Khamoneki\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nAsh's Farfetch'd\nGoh's Farfetch'd\nLancelot\nRegional form\nWeaponry in the Pok\u00e9mon world\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Tapsell, Chris (October 24, 2019). \"Game Freak's Junichi Masuda and Shigeru Ohmori talk inspiration, Sirfetch'd, and pressure from Pok\u00e9mon fans.\" Eurogamer.\n\n\u2191 https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/sword-shield-battle-mechanics-research.3655528/page-64#post-9207497\n\n\u2191 Game Freak explains the 1,000 staff, missing creatures, and leek size of Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield -
