It has long, pointed ears with dark brown tips and black, oval eyes with wrinkles on either side. A curled lock of fur hangs over its forehead, much like its long, tightly curled tail. On its back is a pair of dark pink wings; each wing has three points. Its hands have three fingers each, and its feet have two clawed toes and dark pink soles.\nClefable is a timid, nocturnal creature that flees when it senses people approaching and is one of the world's rarest Pok\u00e9mon. Its sensitive ears can distinctly hear a pin drop from half a mile to 1,100 yards away. Because of its acute hearing, it prefers to live in quiet, mountainous areas of which it is protective. It has also been seen at deserted lakes during a full moon. Using a bouncy gait, it can walk on water and sometimes appears to be flying using its small wings. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Clefairy Tales, Clefable is depicted as an extraterrestrial Pok\u00e9mon. According to one tradition, seeing a pair of Clefable ensures a happy marriage. Some scientists believe Clefable stares intently at the moon because it is homesick. There is also a legend to this, which tells of how it listens for the voices of its kind on the moon during clear and quiet nights. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Clefable is known to sleep in remote places during quiet, moonlit nights. It is theorized that Clefable is dreaming about its friends and distant homeland during its peaceful slumber[1].\nBefore Generation V, Clefable and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Magic Guard as an Ability.\n\nEvolution\nClefable evolves from Clefairy and is the final form of Cleffa.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nCleffa\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nClefairy\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nClefable\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #036\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nA timid fairy Pok\u00e9mon that is rarely seen.

In the fantasy, she evolved from a Clefairy. She later physically debuted in Faba's Revenge! and would go on to appear frequently throughout Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon, becoming the caretaker of the Ultra Guardians base.\n\nOther\nIn Clefairy and the Moon Stone, after the large group of Clefairy blasted Team Rocket away with Metronome, particles of the giant Moon Stone landed on some of them, causing them to evolve into Clefable. This also marked the debut of the species.\nMultiple Clefable appeared for another Mt. Moon Festival in A Real Cleffa-Hanger along with a group of Clefairy, where they were trying to find a missing Cleffa. They later helped send Team Rocket blasting off.\nIn Infinite Possibilities!, a Clefable oversaw an Evolution ritual for a group of six Clefairy, who all eventually evolved into Clefable as well. The first Clefable turned out to be the evolved form of a Clefairy that Professor Cerise had befriended in his youth.\n\nMinor appearances\nIn Pikachu's Vacation, a Clefable was at the Pok\u00e9mon Theme Park.\nIn Stage Fight!, a Clefable was in a stage show about \"talking\" Pok\u00e9mon.\nIn Beauty and the Breeder, a Pok\u00e9mon Breeder's Clefable participated in the Pok\u00e9mon Beauty Contest.\nA Coordinator's Clefable appeared in Deceit and Assist.\nIn New Plot, Odd Lot!, a Coordinator's Clefable competed in the Mulberry Contest.\nIn I Choose You!, a Trainer's Clefable was seen in a Pok\u00e9mon Center and left with its Trainer after a sighting of Entei.\nA Trainer's Clefable appeared in A Young Royal Flame Ignites!.\nIn Securing the Future!, a Trainer's Clefable joined the rest of Alola in showering Necrozma with light so it could return to its normal form.\nA Trainer's Clefable appeared in Turning the Other Mask!.\nA Trainer's Clefable appeared in The Power of Us.\n\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\nSource\n\nEntry\n\n\nEP006\n\nClefable\n\nAsh's Pok\u00e9dex\n\nClefable, an advanced form of Clefairy. These unique creatures are among the rarest Pok\u00e9mon in the world.\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Origins\n Clefable in Pok\u00e9mon Evolutions\nIn File 1: Red, a Clefable was one of the Pok\u00e9mon seen in Professor Oak's introduction.\nA Clefable appeared in a fantasy in File 4: Charizard.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Evolutions\nA Clefable appeared in The Discovery, under the ownership of Green. She used it to battle Elaine's Pikachu but was defeated in one hit.\n\n\nIn the manga\n Clefable in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures\nThe Electric Tale of Pikachu\nAsh, Professor Oak, and Bill befriended a group of Clefairy living on Mt. Moon in Clefairy Tale. They witnessed an evolution ceremony where many of the Clefairy in the group evolved into Clefable using a Moon Stone and then left to explore the world.\n\nPocket Monsters DP\nA Clefable appeared in PMDP16.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Adventures\nMain article: Lusamine's Clefable\nGreen had a Clefairy nicknamed Clefy, which first appeared in A Little Kadabra'll Do It. He later evolved into Clefable in The Winged Legends when Red used his Moon Stone on him. Although he was used only once for distraction against Sabrina prior to evolving, his increased power allowed him to stall Thu-Fi-Zer for a short time with his Metronome. He has since been used as a main member of her team in Green's battle against Lorelei. During the battle, he minimized himself to retrieve her miniature ice sculptures, deliberately blowing off the arm part to let the Elite Four's guard down. He has seen no major appearances since, despite always being listed as a team member.\nA Clefable appeared in The Last Battle XIII as one of the Pok\u00e9mon sent to participate in the fight in Ilex Forest.\nA Clefable appeared in Deprogramming Porygon-Z, under the ownership of an Idol.\nLusamine's Clefable first appeared in Unleashing the Incredible Z-Move.\n\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nManga\n\nChapter\n\nEntry\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Adventures\n\nPS069\n\nAcute hearing, able to detect the sound of a pin drop a kilometer away.\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Pocket Monsters\nMain article: Red's Clefairy\nRed's Clefairy can evolve into Clefable, although it has since devolved back to the Clefairy stage, as Pok\u00e9mon can reverse the evolution process. Clefairy first evolves into Clefable in Clefairy Evolves... At Last?!.\nWhitney has a Clefable, which is Clefairy's childhood friend, as seen in Fierce Battle Between Clefairy and Clefable.\n\nIn the TCG\nMain article: Clefable (TCG)\nOther appearances\nPok\u00e9mon UNITE\n Clefable in Pok\u00e9mon UNITE\nMain article: Clefable (UNITE)\nClefable is playable through obtaining a Unite License. It is a melee supporter that starts as Clefairy, which evolves into Clefable at level 4.\n\n\nTrivia\nThe prototype name for Clefable was Ariala. The Russian dub of Pok\u00e9mon the Series used this name during the original series.\nIn the Polish dub of the episode Clefairy and the Moon Stone, Clefable is called \"Kliferyla\".\nClefable and its pre-evolved form share their category with Snubbull and Granbull. They are all known as the Fairy Pok\u00e9mon.\nThe \"Fairy Pok\u00e9mon\" category predates the introduction of the Fairy-type in Generation VI. From this generation onwards, the type and category of these four Pok\u00e9mon share the same English name. However, this is not true in Japanese, where the type is \u30d5\u30a7\u30a2\u30ea\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7 Fairy-type and the category is \u3088\u3046\u305b\u3044\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3 Y\u014dsei Pok\u00e9mon.\nOrigin\nClefable seems to be based on fairies and pixies since it is a playful, magical, humanoid creature with wings. It may also be inspired by the concept of extraterrestrial life due to its rumored celestial origins and vaguely star-shaped body. It may also reference the mythical Moon rabbit due to its large ears, various Moon related powers, and the fact that it evolves from Clefairy using a Moon Stone.\n\nName origin\nClefable may be a combination of clef (musical symbol) and fable.\nPixy may be derived from pixie.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30d4\u30af\u30b7\u30fc Pixy\n\nFrom pixie\n\n\n French\n\nM\u00e9lodelfe\n\nFrom m\u00e9lodie and elfe\n\n\n Spanish\n\nClefable\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nPixi\n\nFrom pixie\n\n\n Italian\n\nClefable\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ud53d\uc2dc Pixy\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u76ae\u53ef\u897f P\u00edk\u011bx\u012b\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u76ae\u53ef\u897f P\u00e8ihh\u00f3s\u0101i*\u76ae\u53ef\u65af P\u00e8ihh\u00f3s\u012b*\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Arabic\n\n\u0623\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0644\u0627 Ariala\n\nFrom Clefable's prototype English name Ariala\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0915\u094d\u0932\u092b\u093c\u0947\u092c\u0932 Clefable\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nKlefabl\u0117\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041a\u043b\u0435\u0444\u0435\u0439\u0431\u043b Klefeybl\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e04\u0e0b\u0e35 Piksi\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nLusamine's Clefable\nClefable (UNITE)\nRed's Clefable\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0035: Clefairy\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0037: Vulpix\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Clefable_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128854\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monFairy-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to three femalesPok\u00e9mon in the Fast experience groupPink-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 06 Pok\u00e9monFairy group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Sinnoh Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Unova Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hisui Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kitakami Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 473Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 483Pok\u00e9mon with 19 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monNormal-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that have had their type changedPok\u00e9mon whose base stats changed in Generation VI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 16:29.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
