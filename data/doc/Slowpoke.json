It evolves into either Galarian Slowbro when exposed to a Galarica Cuff or Galarian Slowking when exposed to a Galarica Wreath.

It has vacant eyes that never seem focused, curled ears, and a rounded, tan muzzle. It has four legs, each of which ends in a single white claw. Its long, tapering tail has a white tip. This tail drips a sweet, sappy substance that is attractive to many species of fish. Slowpoke uses the tail as a fishing lure. The tail often breaks off, but it will grow back. Slowpoke tails are considered a delicacy and commonly used as a cooking ingredient: in Alola, they are often dried and used in home-cooked stews, while in Galar, they are smoked and packaged as a curry ingredient. Slowpoke is also known to dive underwater to hunt, but is often itself caught instead.\nSlowpoke has a notoriously dim intellect and often forgets what it was doing. It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli. For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten. Slowpoke is commonly found at the water's edge. In some places, it is believed that Slowpoke's yawn causes rain. This Pok\u00e9mon is worshiped in those areas. Its vacant expression is said to help some people relax, whilst causing irritation to others. It is posited that those who lead hectic lives are most likely to become relaxed. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, researchers have debated if Slowpoke is either awake or asleep while it stands around doing nothing.[1]\n\nForms\nSlowpoke has a regional form: Galarian Slowpoke.\nGalarian Slowpoke's body is a slightly different shade of pink, and it has gained yellow colorations on its forehead and tail. This tail is always down and is said to have a spicy taste. Galarian Slowpoke's diet consists of eating spices. Much like its Kantonian counterpart, Galarian Slowpoke is known to relax on seashores and riverbanks without a care in the world. However, sometimes it will get a very sharp look in its eyes as if it is about to think of something tremendous, although it will quickly forget and return to its normal expression afterward.\nIt is believed that this behavior, along with the spicy taste of its tail, is a result of Galarica particles built up from its diet of native Galarica seeds affecting its brain and body.[2] This diet also affects Slowpoke's two different Evolutions, including the Shellder that attaches to it, which is induced by either the Galarica Cuff or the Galarica Wreath. Due to the scent of the spice emanating from its tail, the Galarian Slowpoke often has difficulties while fishing. They can also be found in the Coastal Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Galar's regional life is simulated.\n\nEvolution\nSlowpoke evolves into either Slowbro or Slowking.\nGalarian Slowpoke evolves into either Galarian Slowbro or Galarian Slowking.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nSlowpoke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nSlowpoke\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nSlowbro\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nSlowking\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGalarian Slowpoke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nSlowpokeGalarian Form\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nSlowbroGalarian Form\u00a0Poison\u00a0\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nSlowkingGalarian Form\u00a0Poison\u00a0\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Channel: A Slowpoke is the very slow weatherman.\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: A Slowpoke appears on the Blue Table.

At Seafoam Island, Ash and his friends asked for the professor's help to figure out why Slowpoke only evolve into Slowbro whenever a Shellder clamp on their tails, a question that was giving Professor Oak a headache. Slowpoke evolved when a Shellder that Jessie caught clamped on to the Dopey Pok\u00e9mon's tail.\nIn A Shadow of a Drought, Slowpoke are considered sacred by Azalea Town residents due to legends claiming that Slowpoke's yawning can summon rain.\nIn A Crowning Achievement, multiple Slowpoke were trying to reach a King's Rock to evolve into Slowking in order to help find a better habitat for the group. In this episode, Alice Telesu's Slowpoke, nicknamed Arthur, evolved into a Slowking when its head was bitten by a Shellder while it was wearing the King's Rock.\nIn Slowking's Crowning!, multiple Slowpoke were living on Slowpoke Island.

Depending on what weather Slowpoke predicts (rain, cloudy, or clear), the weather in the game will change too, affecting the Pok\u00e9mon that appear in different areas.\nSometimes, the Slowpoke will fall asleep in the middle of the forecast. This may even result in the weather remaining the same, depending on how long it sleeps.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Melee\nSlowpoke appears as a Pok\u00e9float.

It is unknown why this was changed. However, its striped underside is still partially visible in all of its Gold and Crystal sprites. This striped belly does not appear to be a true error, as it has been seen in artwork by Ken Sugimori, though it is from Generation I.\nLike Mantyke, Slowpoke evolves when another Pok\u00e9mon is attached to it; however, this does not occur in the core series games, but has been shown in spin-off games such as Pok\u00e9mon Snap, as well as in Pok\u00e9mon the Series. Proximity-based Evolution, such as requiring Mantyke and Remoraid to be in the same party, were not introduced until Generation IV.\nSlowpoke is the only Pok\u00e9mon whose multiple Evolutions have different total EV yields: Slowbro has an EV yield of 2, while Slowking has an EV yield of 3.\nDespite numerous Pok\u00e9dex entries stating its lack of response to a bite on its tail, in Pok\u00e9mon Snap it is shown to quickly react to Shellder's bite. This may be due to Shellder's venom stimulating a quicker response, or simply an oversight, if not an intentional game mechanic to speed the process along.\nThe Pok\u00e9mon Company posted a Slowpoke-themed reggae music video onto their Japanese channel titled \u3069\u306a\u3044\u3084\u306d\u3093 \u30e4\u30c9\u30f3 (What's Going on, Yadon?). The song was later dubbed and posted to the English-language channel under the title of Slowpoke Song.\nThough the species has appeared repeatedly, no Slowpoke has ever been seen using an attack in the animated series.\nSlowpoke has the lowest base Speed stat of all Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nIt also has the lowest base Speed stat of all Pok\u00e9mon introduced in Generation I.\nSlowpoke has the fewest move differences between regional forms, having almost identical learnsets with only two differences. The Galarian form learns Acid instead of Water Gun at level 6 and can learn TR81, Foul Play. However, in Generation IX, both forms are able to learn TM062 Foul Play, resulting in there only being one difference between their learnsets.\nSlowpoke is the only Pok\u00e9mon with a regional form with a branched Evolution.\nIt is also the only Pok\u00e9mon to not only not gain a new type in its regional form, but also lose one type without changing the other.\nWhen Galarian Slowpoke was first released, it could use Eviolite despite being unable to evolve at the time (possibly because its evolutions were still programmed in or planned).\nGalarian Slowpoke is the only Pok\u00e9mon with a branched Evolution where both evolved forms share identical type combinations with each other, but not their pre-evolved form.\nUnlike most regional forms, Galarian Slowpoke has a different cry from its regular form. However, this difference does not exist in Pok\u00e9mon GO or Pok\u00e9mon HOME.\nSlowpoke, its Galarian form, and their evolved forms are the only Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon in the Monster Egg Group.\nGalarian Slowpoke is the first regional form Pok\u00e9mon to be added in an update.\nGalarian Slowpoke is the first Galarian form that can be caught outside of Galar.\nOrigin\n  Bulbanews has an article related to this subject: On the Origin of Species: Slowpoke, Slowbro and Slowking  \nIts appearance may also be based on hippopotamuses and giant salamanders. Due to its marine nature, physical appearance, and association with shellfish, Slowpoke may be based on a sea otter. Its ability to grow a new tail if cut off may be inspired by the biological processes of autotomy and regeneration seen in some species of lizards and salamanders.\n\nName origin\nSlowpoke is literally slowpoke, a term for someone who is slow.\nYadon may be a combination of \u5bbf\u501f\u308a yadokari (hermit crab), \u5bbf\u4e3b yadonushi (parasitic host), and \u920d don (dull).
