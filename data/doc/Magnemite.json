Prior to Generation II, it was a pure Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nIt evolves into Magneton starting at level 30, which evolves into Magnezone when leveled up in a special magnetic field or when exposed to a Thunder Stone.\n(Specifics may differ in past games.

It has three Phillips head screws on its body: two near the bottom of its body and the one on top of its head that looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pok\u00e9dex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, it is shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Get Along, Little Pok\u00e9mon that it has emotions and a way of reproducing. In The Pok\u00e9 Spokesman, it exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrition are electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such as power plants or caves with a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, Magnemite has been depicted in carvings discovered at the Ruins of Alph. It has also been present in AZ's retelling of the Kalos war, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years.\nThe magnetic units on Magnemite's body generate an electromagnetic field that allows it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. The units generate stronger magnetic fields the faster they rotate. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive but they may approach Trainers with little notice. If a wild Magnemite is approached, it may simply flee on rare occasions, as Magnemite does not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will retaliate with non-damaging moves. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter. However, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Pok\u00e9 Spokesman, it's shown that it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer. Should it run out of electricity, Magnemite will fall to the ground. Usually, batteries can help recharge it in order for Magnemite to start moving again.\nMagnemite can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a Pok\u00e9tch. In the episode Sparks Fly for Magnemite, it is shown to be attracted to electric Pok\u00e9mon producing such fields. With modern electrical lines buried underground, Magnemite attacks on power plants have increased. To prevent power outages, these power plants deliberately send out signals Magnemite cannot stand to ward them off. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Magnemite is known to sleep airbone by generating electromagnetic waves from its side magnets.[1]There are rare occasions where while Magnemite sleeps and muddles to the direction of its waves, it will loop in the air while sleeping.\n\nEvolution\nMagnemite evolves into Magneton, which evolves into Magnezone.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nMagnemite\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nMagneton\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nMagnezone\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team: A group of Magnemite are the clients of the game's second mission, sending the player to save their friend who is trapped in Thunderwave Cave.

Magneton cannot evolve into Magnezone in Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, due to there being no area in Kanto or Johto with a special magnetic field. Magneton also cannot evolve in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, as Magnezone is not present in those games. There is also no special magnetic field in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield or Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet, so from Generation VIII onwards, Magneton is also able to evolve into Magnezone when exposed to a Thunder Stone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nMagnemite\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\nLevel 30\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nMagneton\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n + Level upin areas with aspecial magnetic field\u2192Thunder StoneVIII+\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nMagnezone\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\nSprites\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed\n\nGreen\n\n\n\nRed\n\nBlue\n\n\n\nYellow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGold\n\n\n\nSilver\n\n\n\nCrystal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration III\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuby\n\nSapphire\n\n\n\nEmerald\n\n\n\nFireRed\n\nLeafGreen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration IV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiamond\n\nPearl\n\n\n\nPlatinum\n\n\n\nHeartGold\n\nSoulSilver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack\n\nWhite\n\n\n\nBlack 2\n\nWhite 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration VI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nY\n\n\n\nOmega Ruby\n\nAlpha Sapphire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration VII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSun\n\nMoon\n\n\n\nUltra Sun\n\nUltra Moon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's Go, Pikachu!\n\n\n\nLet's Go, Eevee!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration VIII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegends: Arceus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-Generation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For other sprites and images, please see Magnemite images on the Bulbagarden Archives.\nIn animation\n Magnemite in Pok\u00e9mon the Series: XY\nMain series\nMajor appearances\nClemont's Magnemite\nClemont owns a Magnemite that first appeared in Clemont's Got a Secret!.

The sense of nostalgia it inspires has only been strengthened by the many years that have passed since its debut in the very first Pok\u00e9mon games.\n\nPOK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu\nA Magnemite appeared in POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu.\n\n\nTrivia\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue beta, Magnemite was originally known as \"Coil\", which was derived from its Japanese name.\nMagnemite and its evolved form were the first Pok\u00e9mon to ever change typing with the progress of generations.\nDespite most of Magnemite's Pok\u00e9dex entries saying they are able to float through the air by employing powerful electromagnetic waves or even anti-gravity, Magnemite does not have the Ability Levitate, so it is still affected by Ground-type moves. However, starting in Generation IV, Magnemite can learn Magnet Rise, which simulates Levitate for five turns.\nMagnemite and Magneton are two of the few Pok\u00e9mon that had their cry changed slightly in Generation III. This was due to Generation III utilizing a better sound effects game engine and newer game system.\nPok\u00e9mon Snap is one of the few times that two Magnemite have been shown bonding, similar to a Magneton. However, when a picture is taken, they are still called Magnemite.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team also showed this, but it was stated to be a failed evolution, due to the lack of a third Magnemite.\nIn 2008, Japanese internet users spammed votes for Magnemite on a Yahoo! Kids poll featuring 9 Pok\u00e9mon appearing in Giratina and the Sky Warrior. Since then, several Japanese Pok\u00e9mon polls have received an unusual amount of votes for Magnemite, including the 2021 Pok\u00e9mon of the Year poll, when it came in 1st place for Kanto Pok\u00e9mon.\nIn Generation V, Magnemite was the most traded Pok\u00e9mon on the GTS. This is probably due to what is known as the Magnemite chain/coil: a scheme by which players could increase the number of visitors to their Join Avenue in Black\u00a02 and White\u00a02 by trading Magnemite on the GTS. The scheme originated with Japanese players and became popular worldwide.\nMagnemite was designed by Ken Sugimori, based on an idea by Satoshi Tajiri.[2]\nOn May 31, 2017, The Pok\u00e9mon Company posted a Magnemite-themed music video onto their YouTube channel titled Where is Coil? Here is Coil!.\nOrigin\nMagnemite is based on magnets[2] and screws, and in broader terms, possibly an objectification of electromagnetism, one of the four fundamental interactions of nature. Magnemite's mysterious mechanical nature, ability to levitate, and appearance on Johto Route 39 \u2014 where the Moomoo Farm is located \u2014 suggest inspirations from UFOs and the idea of aliens kidnapping cattle.\n\nName origin\nMagnemite may be derived from magnetite (a mineral with magnetic properties) or a combination of magnet and mite (minute object).\nCoil may refer to electromagnetic coil.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb Coil\n\nFrom coil\n\n\n French\n\nMagn\u00e9ti\n\nFrom magn\u00e9tique and petit\n\n\n Spanish\n\nMagnemite\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nMagnetilo\n\nFrom Magnet and ilo\n\n\n Italian\n\nMagnemite\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ucf54\uc77c Koil\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5c0f\u78c1\u602a Xi\u01ceoc\u00edgu\u00e0i\n\nFrom \u5c0f xi\u01ceo, \u78c1 c\u00ed, and \u602a gu\u00e0i\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5c0f\u78c1\u602a S\u00educh\u00echgwaai\n\nFrom \u5c0f s\u00edu, \u78c1 ch\u00ech, and \u602a gwaai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05de\u05d2\u05e0\u05de\u05d9\u05d9\u05d8 Magnemayt\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092e\u0948\u0917\u094d\u0928\u0947\u092e\u093e\u0907\u091f Magnemite\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041c\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0439\u0442 Magnemayt\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e25\u0e4c Khoi\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nClemont's Magnemite\nFrancois\nPok\u00e9mon fusion\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 \"What It Takes to Create a Pok\u00e9mon.\" Interview with Ken Sugimori in Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun & Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Moon Edition: The Official National Pok\u00e9dex, p. xv\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0080: Slowbro\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0082: Magneton\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Magnemite_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4127995\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monElectric-type Pok\u00e9monSteel-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monGender-unknown Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupGray-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 04 Pok\u00e9monMineral group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hoenn Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Sinnoh Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Unova Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hisui Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 325Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with 16 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that run from battlePok\u00e9mon that have had their type changedSuper Smash Bros. trophies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 12:37.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
