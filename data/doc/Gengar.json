It is the final form of Gastly.\n(Refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data for more details.)\nAdditionally, Gengar has two forms: Mega Gengar and Gigantamax Gengar. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Gengar using the Gengarite, and can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Gengar if it has the Gigantamax Factor.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biology\n\n1.1 Forms\n1.2 Evolution\n\n\n2 Game data\n\n2.1 NPC appearances\n2.2 Pok\u00e9dex entries\n2.3 Game locations\n\n2.3.1 In side games\n2.3.2 In events\n\n2.3.2.1 Wild Area News\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Held items\n2.5 Stats\n\n2.5.1 Base stats\n\n2.5.1.1 Gengar\n2.5.1.2 Mega Gengar\n\n\n2.5.2 Pok\u00e9athlon stats\n\n\n2.6 Type effectiveness\n2.7 Learnset\n\n2.7.1 By leveling up\n2.7.2 By TM\n2.7.3 By breeding\n2.7.4 By a prior Evolution\n2.7.5 Animated series-only moves\n\n\n2.8 Side game data\n\n2.8.1 Gengar\n2.8.2 Mega Gengar\n\n\n2.9 Form data\n\n2.9.1 Mega Evolution\n2.9.2 Gigantamax\n\n\n2.10 Evolution data\n2.11 Sprites\n\n\n3 In animation\n\n3.1 Main series\n\n3.1.1 Major appearances\n\n3.1.1.1 Morty's Gengar\n3.1.1.2 Agatha's Gengar\n3.1.1.3 Team Meanies\n3.1.1.4 Ash's Gengar\n3.1.1.5 Other\n\n\n3.1.2 Minor appearances\n3.1.3 Pok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n3.2 Pok\u00e9mon Origins\n\n3.2.1 Agatha's Gengar\n3.2.2 Other\n\n\n3.3 Pok\u00e9mon Generations\n\n3.3.1 Agatha's Gengar\n3.3.2 Other\n\n\n3.4 Pok\u00e9mon: Twilight Wings\n3.5 GOTCHA!\n3.6 POK\u00c9TOON\n3.7 Pok\u00e9mon Evolutions\n\n3.7.1 Morty's Gengar\n3.7.2 Other\n\n\n3.8 Bidoof's Big Stand\n3.9 Ghost Dive\n3.10 Biri-Biri\n3.11 Pok\u00e9mon: Paldean Winds\n\n\n4 In the manga\n\n4.1 Ash & Pikachu\n4.2 Daisuki \u2665 Pocket Monsters\n4.3 Pok\u00e9mon Ranger: The Comic \u2013 Shadows of Almia\n4.4 Magical Pok\u00e9mon Journey\n4.5 Pok\u00e9mon Journeys\n4.6 Pocket Monsters DP\n4.7 Pocket Monsters HGSS J\u014d's Big Adventure\n4.8 Pok\u00e9mon Adventures\n\n4.8.1 Pok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n4.9 Pok\u00e9mon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys\n4.10 Pok\u00e9mon: Yeah!

It has red eyes, a wide mouth that is usually curled into a sinister grin, and pointed ears. On its back are numerous spikes and it has smaller spikes on top of its head similar to tufty fur. Its arms and legs are short with three digits on both its hands and feet. It also has a stubby tail.\nGengar has the ability to hide perfectly in the shadow of any object, granting it exceptional stealth. However, Gengar's body acts as a heat sink. Its presence cools the temperature of the surrounding area by nearly 10\u00a0\u00b0F (5\u00a0\u00b0C), because it absorbs the warmth. It is shown in Pok\u00e9mon the Series that Gengar can fly,[1] possess people[2] and other Pok\u00e9mon, create illusions[3] and extend its tongue[4] by several meters. In Generation I, Night Shade was its signature move.\nGengar is very mischievous, and at times, malicious. It enjoys playing practical jokes and casting curses, such as pretending to be one's shadow, then behaving erratically. When the quarry notices, the Gengar takes delight in its victim's terror. However, Gengar has been known to be loyal to a Trainer who treats it well. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Gengar is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in caves and dark places where shadows form. It is especially fond of urban areas such as cities and back alleys, but only during the night. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Gengar is known to sleep deeply while hiding in the shadow of a target it plans to curse.[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGengar floating in the air\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGengar in Ash's shadow\n\n\n\n\nForms\nGengar has two forms: Mega Gengar and Gigantamax Gengar.\nAs Mega Gengar, a portion of its body sinks into the ground and its arms and tail lengthen. The lower portions turn a more reddish-purple, and a third eye appears on its forehead. This new unblinking eye is oval, yellow, and allows it to see into other dimensions.[6] The spikes on Mega Gengar's back are more numerous and pointed, and additional spikes appear on its hands and tail. Its ears are now considerably longer and tilt backward.\nMega Gengar has the ability to access other dimensions and has a vicious nature. Mega Gengar has no interest in opponents unless perceived as prey. Its relationships are warped due to Mega Evolution. It now desires to take and curse the life of anyone or anything in its path; it may even curse its own Trainer. Mega Gengar sinks into another dimension to wait for a chance to attack.\nAs Gigantamax Gengar, it becomes larger, with portions of its body sinking into the ground, and only the head, tail, and arms remain. Its body changes from dark-purple to light-purple and its eyes become white with yellow sclera. The inside of its mouth changes to resemble a tunnel with a long purple tongue sticking out. Three red clouds surround the top of Gengar's head.\nGigantamax Gengar's mouth is rumored to not lead into its body. Due to the cursed energy, it is believed to instead lead into the afterlife. By laying a trap, it attempts to steal the lives of those it captures. Should someone stand near its mouth, they can hear the voices of their loved ones calling out to them.\nGigantamax Gengar is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Terror.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMega Gengar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGigantamax Gengar\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nGengar evolves from Haunter and is the final form of Gastly.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nGastly\u00a0Ghost\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nHaunter\u00a0Ghost\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nGengar\u00a0Ghost\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\n\n\nSpoiler warning: this article may contain major plot or ending details.\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: A Gengar appears in a bonus stage accessible from the Red Table. Once the player has knocked out the three Gastly and the pair of Haunter, a Gengar appears and must be defeated to win.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team: Gengar is the leader of Team Meanies. While often accompanied by Ekans and Medicham, Gengar will often act alone and spends much of the game causing trouble, even convincing the village to exile the hero, blaming them for the natural disasters plaguing the world. However, it is later revealed that he is the actual cursed human, having been cursed by Ninetales to be reborn as a Pok\u00e9mon. After Rayquaza destroys the meteor heading for the world, Gengar will post a request, asking to visit Ninetales in the hopes of bringing back Gardevoir. While she is rescued, she has no recollection of her times with her Trainer, but Gengar is still satisfied to see her safe and leaves.\n\n\n\n\nSpoilers end here.\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #094\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nUnder a full moon, this Pok\u00e9mon likes to mimic the shadows of people and laugh at their fright.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nA Gengar is close by if you feel a sudden chill.

Eventually, it was taken down when Koga used the tail that the old woman's Arbok bit off his own, distracting it long enough for Blue's Porygon to deal the finishing blow.\nIn The Last Battle XIII, a Gengar was sent to participate in the fight in Ilex Forest.\nA Gengar was seen in Return to Pallet Town. It was used by a kid from Pallet Town in an attempt to catch a Nidorino, thus replicating the opening sequence of the Generation I video games and their remakes.\nIn Tying Trevenant, a Gengar belonging to Gurkinn appeared, stopping Celosia's Aegislash from killing X. He helped battle Team Flare to stop them from obtaining the tree form of Xerneas and was later given to X, where he was nicknamed Garma. He can Mega Evolve into Mega Gengar.\nAllister's Gengar first appeared in Glittering!! The Tapestry in the Vault. It is capable of Gigantamaxing.\n\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nManga\n\nChapter\n\nEntry\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Adventures\n\nPS077\n\nAble to merge with and inhabit the shadow of another being.\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys\nMain article: Morty's Gengar\nIn A Promise Given to Miltank, Morty called out Gengar to stop a Spearow from stealing the satchel that contained Berries collected by Gold.\n\nPok\u00e9mon: Yeah!

Its moves include Shadow Ball, Hypnosis, Shadow Punch, and Curse. Upon entering Synergy Burst, it Mega Evolves and can use the Burst Attack Shadow Drop.\n\nDetective Pikachu\nA Gengar appears in the first Detective Pikachu game.\n\nPOK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu\nMultiple Gengar appeared in POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu. One of them was seen in an illegal fight club battle against a Blastoise, where it won.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nGengar appears as a Spirit.\n\nPok\u00e9mon UNITE\nMain article: Gengar (UNITE)\nGengar is playable through obtaining a Unite License. It is a melee speedster that starts as Gastly and evolves into Haunter at level 5, which evolves into Gengar at level 9.\n\n\nTrivia\nIn the English Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue beta, Gengar's prototype name was \"Phantom\". This is similar to Gengar's Korean name, which is \ud32c\ud140 Phantom.\nGengar is Ken Sugimori's favorite Pok\u00e9mon. The reason for this is because he finds that Gengar is the easiest Pok\u00e9mon to draw.[7][8]\nDespite Gengar and its evolutionary relatives all being part Poison-type, none of them were able to learn any Poison-type moves by leveling up until Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!.\nGengar is one of the first two Pok\u00e9mon to appear in a Pok\u00e9mon battle both in Pok\u00e9mon the Series and in the games, the other being Nidorino. This is due to their appearance in the opening animation of Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green, on which the beginning of the first TV episode was based on, as well as the Red and Green remakes.\nGengar, along with Nidorino (and possibly other Pok\u00e9mon), originate from the Capsule Monsters game design pitch, which would eventually become the Pok\u00e9mon series.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, Gengar was the only Pok\u00e9mon included in the credits that did not appear in the credits of Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon X and Y, Gengar is the only Pok\u00e9mon with the Ability Levitate that is not eligible for Sky Battles.\nMega Gengar has the highest base Special Attack stat of all Ghost-type and Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nWhen viewing Mega Gengar's Pok\u00e9dex entry, the camera's view can only be moved sideways.\nGengar could be seen as a counterpart to Alakazam. They are both the last stage of a three-part evolutionary line, require trading to reach their final stage of evolution, and are capable of Mega Evolution. They are the same height, and both get shorter upon Mega Evolution. They share a base friendship of 70 and, since Generation VI, a base stat total of 500. Both are weak to the other's STAB, and they share weaknesses to the Ghost and Dark types. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Ancient Puzzle of Pok\u00e9mopolis, a Gengar and an Alakazam are put against each other.\nGengar could also be seen as a counterpart to Machamp. They are, like Alakazam, the last stage of a three-part evolutionary line, can both be obtained through evolution induced by trade, and are capable of Gigantamaxing in Generation VIII. Both Gengar and Machamp also share a base friendship of 70. While both are weak against Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon, as Gengar is part Poison-type and Machamp is a Fighting-type, Gengar can counter it with its Ghost typing.\nWhen being escorted through Mt. Freeze and Murky Cave in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team, Gengar knows Leer, Scratch, and Quick Attack, although it cannot learn those moves by any means in any generation. These are the exact same moves Absol has when joining the player's team during this point in the main story. It's likely the data was unintentionally copied over, as escort Pok\u00e9mon are uniquely coded from normal Pok\u00e9mon. In the Rescue Team remake, Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX, Gengar's moves were changed to Hypnosis, Dream Eater, Shadow Ball, and Sucker Punch.\nGengar's identity as a former human, as described by the Pok\u00e9dex in Generation VII, may have been inspired by its portrayal in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team, which was released 11 years before Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon.\nIn the core series games, Mega Gengar has small feet that can be seen by recalling it and sending it out. A glitch in Pok\u00e9mon GO also allows Mega Gengar's feet to be seen. In Pokk\u00e9n Tournament, however, Mega Gengar does not have feet. Instead, a portal appears beneath it whenever it is airborne. Its tail will disappear as well.\nWhen Gengar Gigantamaxes, it doesn't grow on screen. Instead, it pops out of the ground.\nGengar is the only Pok\u00e9mon capable of both Gigantamax and Mega Evolution that is not one of the Kanto first partner Pok\u00e9mon.\nGengar is the only Ghost-type to have a Gigantamax form.\nIn Generation VI, due to a glitch, on the first turn of becoming Mega Gengar, it can still be affected by Telekinesis.\nGengar is tied with Snorlax for the most Pok\u00e9dex entries in Pok\u00e9mon the Series, with a total of 7.\nDesign variations\nGengar's Shiny coloration is inconsistent between official media.\n\nIn the Generation II core series games as well as several side series games, Shiny Gengar has a dark, near-black, purple coloration with bright magenta eyes, as seen in Pok\u00e9mon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, the Pok\u00e9mon Stadium series, Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum, Pok\u00e9mon XD: Gale of Darkness, and Pok\u00e9mon Battle Revolution.\nIn the core series games, Pok\u00e9mon HOME, Pok\u00e9mon GO, and Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Shiny Gengar has a dull purple coloration with reddish pink eyes.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Shuffle, Pok\u00e9mon Duel, as well as in the animated series, Shiny Gengar has a lighter, bluer coloration with reddish eyes.\n\n\n\n\nShiny Gengar's Crystal sprite\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Gengar's Stadium model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Gengar's XD box sprite\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Gengar's Battle Revolution box sprite\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Gengar's HOME art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Gengar's Shuffle icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Gengar's Duel figure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Gengar in Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel\n\n\n\n\nConcept and development\nGigantamax Gengar and its Shiny form were designed by James Turner.[9][10]\n\nOrigin\nGengar appears to be based on a ghost. It may also be loosely inspired by the Cheshire Cat, as it possesses pointed ears; a large, toothy grin; and the ability to vanish. Gengar's many abilities revolving around shadows, as well as its Pok\u00e9mon category, may also suggest it is partially based on shadow people.\nSome of Gengar's traits, such as its Poison type and extremely light weight, seem to be based on Fuy\u016brei, floating spirits said to be able to spread diseases.\nDue to its horn-like ears, teeth, ability to float in the air, and dark nature, Gengar may also be based on the oni. Oni sometimes have a third eye in the center of their forehead, which could be the basis for Mega Gengar.\n\nName origin\nGengar and Gangar may be derived from Doppelg\u00e4nger (ghostly double of a living person). It may also involve \u5e7b gen (phantasm).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b2\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc Gangar\n\nFrom Doppelg\u00e4nger\n\n\n French\n\nEctoplasma\n\nFrom ectoplasme\n\n\n Spanish\n\nGengar\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nGengar\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Italian\n\nGengar\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ud32c\ud140 Penteom\n\nFrom phantom\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u803f\u9b3c G\u011bnggu\u01d0\n\nFrom the transcription of Japanese name and \u9b3c gu\u01d0\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u803f\u9b3c G\u00e1nggw\u00e1i\n\nFrom the transcription of Japanese name and \u9b3c gw\u00e1i\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0917\u0947\u0902\u0917\u093e\u0930 Gengar\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0413\u0435\u043d\u0433\u0430\u0440 Gengar\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32 Kengka\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nAsh's Gengar\nAgatha's Gengar\nMorty's Gengar\nGengar (Pokk\u00e9n)\nGengar (UNITE)\nTeam Meanies\nMega Evolution\nGigantamax\nReferences\n\n\u2191 The Screen Actor's Guilt\n\n\u2191 Why Not Give Me a Z-Ring Sometime?\n\n\u2191 Illusion Confusion!\n\n\u2191 A Ghost of a Chance\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 Pok\u00e9mon X and Y site | Mega Pok\u00e9mon (archived)\n\n\u2191 Creator Profile: The Creators of Pikachu - Pok\u00e9mon.com (archived)\n\n\u2191 Page 4 of interview with Game Freak, hosted on Nintendo's official website (Japanese, archived)\n\n\u2191 Tweet by James Turner (@JamesTurner_42).
