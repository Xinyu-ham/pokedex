However, it consistently appears as a black, spherical Pok\u00e9mon surrounded by a purple haze. Gastly has a wide, pink mouth with two visible fangs. Though its eyes seem to extend past its round body, visible eyelids surround them.\nIt produces a faint, sweet smell. The toxic gas surrounding the main body can induce fainting and suffocation, and it is capable of enshrouding an enemy of any size. Gastly's gaseous form makes it one of the lightest Pok\u00e9mon in existence. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Tower of Terror suggests that Gastly has a playful personality, often frightening and playing pranks on people for fun. However, in the episode A Shipful of Shivers, it shows a willingness to preserve or pass on the memories of departed humans. It is also shown in The Ghost of Maiden's Peak changing form and creating illusions, and it is capable of phasing through solid objects and forming tangible hands out of its gasses. Gastly can be found within caves and old, dilapidated buildings, but may also be seen outdoors during nighttime. Its gaseous body will dwindle away when exposed to strong winds, so they huddle together in decent-sized groups under house eaves to avoid the wind. It may also cause flickering lights in abandoned houses. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Gastly is known to sleep while floating.[1]A sleeping Gastly is said give a sudden surprise should someone approach it.\nIn Generation I, Night Shade was its signature move.\n\nEvolution\nGastly evolves into Haunter, which evolves into Gengar.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nGastly\u00a0Ghost\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nHaunter\u00a0Ghost\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nGengar\u00a0Ghost\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: Three Gastly appear in a bonus stage accessible from the Red Table.

You'll get hurt if they so much as come into contact with you, so be on your guard. As ghosts, they're immune to direct attacks. The only way to defeat them is to hit them with projectiles or items.\n\nTrivia\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue beta, Gastly's prototype name was \"Spirit\".\nDespite all of them being Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon, Gastly and its evolutionary line cannot learn any Poison-type moves by leveling up outside of Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! and Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus.\nGastly is tied with:\nVenipede for the lowest base HP stat of all Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nWeedle for the lowest Defense stat of all Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nHaunter for the lightest Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nHaunter and Roaming Form Gimmighoul for the lightest Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nGastly is the only Pok\u00e9mon that weighs exactly the same as its evolution.\nOrigin\nGastly may be based on a hitodama or an onibi, Japanese spirits similar to a will-o'-the-wisp, and poisonous gases.\nSome of Gastly's traits, such as its Poison type and extremely light weight, seem to be based on Fuy\u016brei, floating spirits said to be able to spread diseases.\n\nName origin\nGastly may be a combination of gas, ghost, and ghastly (frightful).\nGhos may be derived from ghost and gas.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b4\u30fc\u30b9 Ghos\n\nFrom ghost and gas\n\n\n French\n\nFantominus\n\nFrom fant\u00f4me and minus\n\n\n Spanish\n\nGastly\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nNebulak\n\nFrom Nebel, nebula, and ach\n\n\n Italian\n\nGastly\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uace0\uc624\uc2a4 Goohs\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u9b3c\u65af Gu\u01d0s\u012b\n\nFrom \u9b3c gu\u01d0 and the transcription of Japanese name or possibly \u74e6\u65af w\u01ces\u012b\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u9b3c\u65af Gw\u00e1is\u012b\n\nFrom \u9b3c gw\u00e1i and the transcription of Japanese name or possibly \u74e6\u65af ng\u00e1hs\u012b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0917\u0948\u0938\u094d\u091f\u0932\u0940 Gastly\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0413\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043b\u0438 Gastli\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e42\u0e01\u0e2a Kot\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nGengar (UNITE)\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0091: Cloyster\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0093: Haunter\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Gastly_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128559\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monGhost-type Pok\u00e9monPoison-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon without Hidden AbilitiesPok\u00e9mon in the Medium Slow experience groupPurple-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 01 Pok\u00e9monAmorphous group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Sinnoh Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hisui Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kitakami Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 310Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with 15 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monSuper Smash Bros. trophies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 16:23.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
