Its brick-patterned yellow hide is dry and tough, blends in with desert sand, and protects its soft white underbelly and muzzle. Sandshrew has blue, almond-shaped eyes, a pointed snout, and triangular ears with white insides. Its tail is thick and conical. It has two long claws on each foot and three sharp claws on its forepaws, which are used to burrow.\nSandshrew spends much of its time hidden underground in deep burrows. It only emerges to lunge and drag in passing Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon. Sandshrew can quickly curl into a tight ball to protect itself from great falls and opponents but may also throw sand at attackers. While its body can efficiently absorb water to facilitate life in the desert, Sandshrew has been found in caves as well. It also lives deep underground in nests it has created from digging tunnels. Should hard rocks get in the way of digging, Sandshrew will use its sharp claws to remove them before continuing to dig. If it is too wet, its skin becomes wrinkly. It dries itself out by using the geothermal heat near a volcano. It is also known to bathe in sand, which helps remove dirt and moisture from its body.\n\n\nForms\n Concept artwork of Alolan Sandshrew for Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon\nSandshrew has a regional form: Alolan Sandshrew.\nIn the Alola region, Sandshrew migrated to snowy mountains due to the volcanic activity near the desert areas. Its body is a light, icy blue, with a cream-colored belly and muzzle. Thicker plates form a dome around its head, and its ears resemble an igloo's entrances. Adapting to this cold climate, its body became larger and heavier, with a shell of hard ice covering its hide. The shell is also made of very hard steel.\nThis steel-like covering grants it extra defense from predators like Sneasel, but it is unable to curl into a ball like its desert counterpart; smarter predators such as Weavile exploit its soft underbelly. Alolan Sandshrew can burrow itself in the snow to avoid being blown away by blizzards. Its claws allow it to move without slipping on icy surfaces, but it slides on its stomach when it needs to move quickly.[2] A traditional Alolan custom during festivals is a competition to see who can slide Alolan Sandshrew across the ice the farthest. They can also be found in the Polar Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated.\n\n\nEvolution\nSandshrew evolves into Sandslash.\nAlolan Sandshrew evolves into Alolan Sandslash.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nSandshrew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nSandshrew\u00a0Ground\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nSandslash\u00a0Ground\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlolan Sandshrew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nSandshrewAlolan Form\u00a0Ice\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nSandslashAlolan Form\u00a0Ice\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #027\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nBurrows deep underground in arid locations far from water.
