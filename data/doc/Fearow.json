It has a long, pointed, pink beak and a decorative red coxcomb on top of its head. Its narrow eyes have very small pupils and do not appear to have colored irises. It has shaggy feathers at the base of its neck and covering the upper portion of its wings. These feathers are cream-colored, as are the tips of its flight feathers. Its sharp-clawed talons are pink, with three toes pointing forward and one pointing backward.\nFearow has been around mostly unchanged for many years, as a Pok\u00e9mon resembling it has been seen on ancient murals. Its large wings and stamina allow it to fly for an entire day without landing. Its long neck and beak allow it to pluck prey from both land and water, and it has even been known to steal from unwary humans. It will shoot upward, and then dive down to catch prey. It will also catch tiny insects that hide underground and circle the ocean for fish. Fearow are found naturally in open habitats with warmer climates, mainly wastelands and desolate fields.\n\nEvolution\nFearow evolves from Spearow.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nSpearow\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nFearow\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Ranger: Fearow is Spenser's partner Pok\u00e9mon.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #022\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nWith its huge and magnificent wings, it can keep aloft without ever having to land for rest.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nA Pok\u00e9mon that dates back many years.

Its long neck and beak are also reminiscent of various water birds such as cormorants, darters, storks, and herons, particularly the Goliath heron. Its Pok\u00e9dex entries describe multiple hunting methods, either divebombing prey like falcons and hawks or probing through soil and water like sandpipers and snipes.\n\nName origin\nFearow may be a combination of fear (referring to its intimidating appearance) and sparrow. It may also involve feather and arrow (referring to its sharp beak).\nOnidrill may be a combination of \u9b3c oni (demon), \u9ce5 tori (bird), and \u30c9\u30ea\u30eb doriru (drill).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30aa\u30cb\u30c9\u30ea\u30eb Onidrill\n\nFrom \u9b3c oni, \u9ce5 tori, and drill\n\n\n French\n\nRapasdepic\n\nFrom rapace, pic, piquer, and a pun of as de pique\n\n\n Spanish\n\nFearow\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nIbitak\n\nFrom Ibis and Attacke\n\n\n Italian\n\nFearow\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uae68\ube44\ub4dc\ub9b4\uc870 Kebidrillzo\n\nFrom \ub3c4\uae68\ube44 dokkaebi, drill, and \uc870 (\u9ce5) jo\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5927\u5634\u96c0 D\u00e0zu\u01d0qu\u00e8\n\nFrom \u5927\u5634 d\u00e0 zu\u01d0 and \u9ebb\u96c0 m\u00e1qu\u00e8\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5927\u5634\u96c0 Daaihj\u00e9uijeuk\u9b54\u96c0 M\u014djeuk *\n\nFrom \u5927\u5634 daai j\u00e9ui and \u9ebb\u96c0 m\u00e0hjeukFrom \u9b54\u9b3c m\u014dgw\u00e1i and \u9ebb\u96c0 m\u00e0hjeuk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5 Fearo\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092b\u093c\u093f\u092f\u0930\u094b Fearow\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nJie\u010dius\n\nTranslation of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0424\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0443 Firou\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e42\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e34\u0e14\u0e23\u0e34\u0e25 Onidrin\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nAsh's Fearow\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0021: Spearow\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0023: Ekans\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Fearow_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4129076\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monNormal-type Pok\u00e9monFlying-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupBrown-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 09 Pok\u00e9monFlying group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 442Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became both Special Attack and Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 20 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are included in the Japan-only Pok\u00e9mon Stadium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 22:10.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
