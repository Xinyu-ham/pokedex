It has a long, tubular mouth, narrow, black eyes, a fin-like ridge above each eye, and spiny pectoral fins. It also has a large, coiled tail. It has a pair of dorsal fins with sharp, cream-colored tips that exude venom. Seadra's venom is toxic enough to induce numbness and even fainting in humans, but it is still prized among practitioners of traditional medicine.\nSeadra can swim in any direction while facing forward by rapidly flapping its fins and tail. It catches its prey by spinning its body to create large whirlpools. When its prey is exhausted, Seadra swallows it whole using its long snout. Seadra makes its nest by either wriggling between or anchoring itself to branches of coral under the ocean. After a female Seadra gives birth, the male Seadra will take care of the young. It is markedly vicious and will mercilessly attack those who venture near its nest. During this time, the male's venom also becomes thicker and stronger than usual.\n\nEvolution\nSeadra evolves from Horsea and evolves into Kingdra.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nHorsea\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nSeadra\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nKingdra\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Dragon\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #117\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nCapable of swimming backwards by rapidly flapping its wing-like pectoral fins and stout tail.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nTouching the back fin causes numbness.

It was defeated by Clair's Dragonair.\n\n\nIn the TCG\nMain article: Seadra (TCG)\nTrivia\nSeadra's EV Yield (1 Defense, 1 Sp. Atk) is unique.\nSeadra's Gold and HeartGold Pok\u00e9dex entries likely refer to the real-world theory of evolution.\nSeadra and its evolutionary relatives share their category with Dratini, its evolved forms, Salamence, and Kalosian Goodra. They are all known as the Dragon Pok\u00e9mon.\nSeadra is the only Pok\u00e9mon that may have the Poison Point Ability without being a Poison-type itself.\nIt is also the only member of its evolutionary line to not have Swift Swim as its Ability.\nOrigin\nSeadra seems to be based on a seahorse, possibly the spiny seahorse. Its category may be a reference to the Japanese word for seahorse, \u7adc\u306e\u843d\u3068\u3057\u5b50 tatsu-no-otoshigo (literally \"illegitimate child of a dragon\"), which is derived from the myth that a seahorse that lives for a century will transform into a dragon. Its spiky, poisonous fins are reminiscent of a lionfish, its ability to shoot ink is reminiscent of a squid, and the shape of its snout and Sniper Ability are reminiscent of a water gun.\n\nName origin\nSeadra may be a combination of sea, seahorse, dragon, seadragon (a type of animal related to seahorses), and Hydra (a mythological water creature).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b7\u30fc\u30c9\u30e9 Seadra\n\nFrom sea, seahorse, dragon, seadragon, and Hydra\n\n\n French\n\nHypoc\u00e9an\n\nFrom hippocampe, hypo- and oc\u00e9an\n\n\n Spanish\n\nSeadra\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n German\n\nSeemon\n\nFrom Seepferd and Monster\n\n\n Italian\n\nSeadra\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc2dc\ub4dc\ub77c Seadra\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u6d77\u523a\u9f8d / \u6d77\u523a\u9f99 H\u01ceic\u00ecl\u00f3ng\n\nFrom \u6d77 h\u01cei, \u9f8d / \u9f99 l\u00f3ng, \u6d77\u9f8d / \u6d77\u9f99 h\u01ceil\u00f3ng, and \u523a c\u00ec\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u6d77\u523a\u9f8d H\u00f3ichil\u00f9hng*\u98db\u523a\u6d77\u99ac F\u0113ichih\u00f3im\u00e1h*\n\nFrom \u6d77 h\u00f3i, \u9f8d l\u00f9hng, \u6d77\u9f8d h\u00f3il\u00f9hng, and \u523a chiFrom \u98db f\u0113i, \u523a chi, and \u6d77\u99ac h\u00f3im\u00e1h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0938\u0940\u0921\u094d\u0930\u093e Seadra\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0421\u0438\u0434\u0440\u0430 Sidra\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e14\u0e23\u0e32 Sidra\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0116: Horsea\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0118: Goldeen\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Seadra_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4144766\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monWater-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupBlue-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 05 Pok\u00e9monWater 1 group Pok\u00e9monDragon group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hoenn Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 440Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with 17 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with cross-generational EvolutionsPok\u00e9mon that evolve through tradingPok\u00e9mon that evolve through held itemsPok\u00e9mon that evolve by trading with a held itemPok\u00e9mon that evolve by trading holding Dragon Scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 13 October 2024, at 12:17.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
