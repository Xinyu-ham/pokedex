It has a pink, polyhedral head that ends in a blue beak and has hexagonal eyes, and it has a pink polyhedral body with a blue front, blue triangular prism feet, and a blue rectangular prism tail. In 3D games, such as Pok\u00e9mon Stadium, it can open its beak and can detach its limbs and head from its torso. According to its Pok\u00e9dex entries, it has copy protection built into its code, preventing duplication through electronic means. It was created in 1995 by Silph Co.,[1] but documents at Silph Co. claim it was created at the Pok\u00e9mon Lab on Cinnabar Island using the state-of-the-art technology of its time. Because it was created decades ago, many of its parts have since become obsolete. It was the first artificial Pok\u00e9mon to have ever been created through computer programming. In ancient Hisui, people were confused about Porygon and its evolutions due to them arriving through space-time distortions and being the product of far more advanced technology than what was available at the time.\nDue to its man-made origins, Porygon does not need to breathe or eat, though it can still accept food if given. It has the ability to convert its body into digital data, allowing it to travel through cyberspace. Recently, it has become more helpful inside cyberspace by searching for any suspicious data that exists. Some believed Porygon has the power to potentially travel in space despite the species not displaying that ability yet. Because it is man-made, it is generally found in computers or in labs and other buildings where people work.\nPorygon and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Conversion and Conversion 2. Prior to Generation V, Sharpen was also one of its signature moves. Additionally, prior to Generation V, Porygon and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Download as an Ability. It can use Conversion to change its appearance to mimic another Pok\u00e9mon's and has also demonstrated the ability to change color for camouflage.\n\n\nEvolution\nPorygon evolves into Porygon2, which evolves into Porygon-Z.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nPorygon\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPorygon2\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nPorygon-Z\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky: In the Future of Darkness, Porygon live past Spacial Cliffs.

Ticketed Special Research, Decoding Porygon.\n\nEvolution data\nPorygon evolves into Porygon2 when traded while holding an Upgrade, which evolves into Porygon-Z when traded while holding a Dubious Disc. Porygon cannot evolve into Porygon2 in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen until the player obtains the National Pok\u00e9dex, as its evolution will be interrupted. Porygon also cannot evolve into Porygon2 in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, as Porygon2 is not present in those games. In Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus, Porygon evolves into Porygon2 when exposed to an Upgrade, which evolves into Porygon-Z when exposed to a Dubious Disc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nPorygon\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n + Tradeholding Upgrade\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPorygon2\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n + Tradeholding Dubious Disc\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nPorygon-Z\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\nSprites\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed\n\nGreen\n\n\n\nRed\n\nBlue\n\n\n\nYellow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGold\n\n\n\nSilver\n\n\n\nCrystal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration III\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuby\n\nSapphire\n\n\n\nEmerald\n\n\n\nFireRed\n\nLeafGreen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration IV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiamond\n\nPearl\n\n\n\nPlatinum\n\n\n\nHeartGold\n\nSoulSilver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack\n\nWhite\n\n\n\nBlack 2\n\nWhite 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration VI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nY\n\n\n\nOmega Ruby\n\nAlpha Sapphire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration VII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSun\n\nMoon\n\n\n\nUltra Sun\n\nUltra Moon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's Go, Pikachu!\n\n\n\nLet's Go, Eevee!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration VIII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegends: Arceus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-Generation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For other sprites and images, please see Porygon images on the Bulbagarden Archives.\nIn animation\n Porygon in Pok\u00e9mon the Series\n Porygon in Aim to Be a Pok\u00e9mon Master\nMajor appearances\nPorygon's only major animated series appearance was in EP038. Dr. Akihabara created two specimens, one of which was stolen by Team Rocket, while the other one was borrowed by Ash and his friends. Both remained with Dr. Akihabara at the end of the episode.\nThis episode caused more than 600 children in Japan to be transferred to hospitals by ambulance because of seizure-like symptoms they reported, due to a flashing strobe effect present at several points of the episode, and was therefore banned and never aired again anywhere in the world. Since then, Porygon has never played a main role in the animated series, with its evolved forms, Porygon2 and Porygon-Z not having any appearances in an episode.\n\nMinor appearances\nPorygon made its English dub debut in a scene transition in A Chansey Operation. A similar transition appears in Lights, Camera, Quack-tion.\nPorygon appeared in the Who's That Pok\u00e9mon? segment for the English dub of A Way Off Day Off, and was featured with an English voice, making this the only time Porygon appeared with such a voice in the animated series.\nIn the opening sequence of both Celebi: The Voice of the Forest and Pok\u00e9mon Heroes: Latios & Latias (the former only in the case of the dub, since said intro sequence was originally made for the latter), a Porygon can be seen floating behind a wire fence in a city.\nIn a shot in a \"World of Pok\u00e9mon\" opening at the beginning of The Journey to be a Pok\u00e9mon Master Begins!!, a Porygon was floating above a fence, similar to the aforementioned movies.\nPorygon made a cameo appearance in the \"World of Pok\u00e9mon\" opening of Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice, which featured every Pok\u00e9mon from the first five generations revealed to that point.\nA Porygon appeared as an image in Partner Promises!.\n\nIn the manga\n Porygon in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures\nPok\u00e9mon Adventures\nRed, Green & Blue arc\nMain article: Blue's Porygon\nBlue obtained a Porygon at the Rocket Game Corner in A Tale of Ninetales, and it soon became a core member of his team. Prior to Volume 13, it evolved into a Porygon2.\n\nPlatinum arc\nA Porygon appeared at the Battle Factory in Uprooting Seedot.\n\nSun, Moon, Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon arc\nA Porygon appeared in The Announcement and the Prize, under the ownership of Gladion.

It damages players that come into contact with it.\nPorygon's only appearance in Melee is that of a Pok\u00e9 Float. When the fighting is on Slowpoke's tail, three will travel across the top of the screen. However, they move too quickly to land on and so are little more than decoration in practice.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nPorygon retains its role as a stage element in the Saffron City stage, as well as appearing as a Spirit.\n\nTrivia\nPorygon is the only Pok\u00e9mon that evolves by trade twice: once holding the Upgrade into Porygon2, and a second time (as Porygon2) into Porygon-Z when holding a Dubious Disc. It is also the only Pok\u00e9mon in a three-stage evolutionary line that does not require leveling up to trigger any of its evolutions (i.e. it is possible to acquire a Porygon-Z at level 1).\nPorygon's evolutionary line is the only three-stage evolutionary line whose members were all considered fully evolved during their respective debut generations.\nPorygon is the only Pok\u00e9mon to have its category changed in Japanese. Its category in Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green is \u30b7\u30fc\u30b8\u30fc\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3 CG Pok\u00e9mon, which was changed to \u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3 Virtual Pok\u00e9mon from Pok\u00e9mon Blue onwards.\nAccording to the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, Porygon was developed in the year 1995.\nOrigin\nPorygon seems to be based on a bird or paper crane that has been rendered using digital software. The head-tipping motion it displays in some games is reminiscent of a drinking bird toy. The flat shapes comprising its body are similar to the polygon mesh used to create 3D computer graphics. Its Pok\u00e9dex entries imply a connection to artificial intelligence and robotic spacecraft.\nIn a 1997 interview with the magazine Famimaga 64, Satoshi Tajiri stated that Porygon was created out of irony. According to him, during the development of Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green, people kept telling him that he was too late on making a game for the Game Boy, and that he should start making games with 3D polygonal graphics for next generation consoles. As a result, he included Porygon, a Pok\u00e9mon made out of polygons, in the sprite-based Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green, hence the irony.[2]\n\nName origin\nPorygon is a corruption of polygon.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30dd\u30ea\u30b4\u30f3 Porygon\n\nFrom polygon\n\n\n French\n\nPorygon\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Spanish\n\nPorygon\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n German\n\nPorygon\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Italian\n\nPorygon\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ud3f4\ub9ac\uace4 Porygon\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u591a\u908a\u7378 / \u591a\u8fb9\u517d Du\u014dbi\u0101nsh\u00f2u*3D\u9f8d / 3D\u9f99 3D L\u00f3ng*\n\nFrom \u591a\u908a\u5f62 / \u591a\u8fb9\u5f62 du\u014dbi\u0101nx\u00edng and \u7378 / \u517d sh\u00f2uFrom 3D and \u9f8d / \u9f99 l\u00f3ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u591a\u908a\u7378 D\u014db\u012bnsau*\u7acb\u65b9\u7378 Laahpf\u014dngsau*\n\nFrom \u591a\u908a\u5f62 d\u014db\u012bny\u00echng and \u7378 sauFrom \u7acb\u65b9 laahpf\u014dng and \u7378 sau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Greek\n\n\u03a0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c5\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd Porygon\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092a\u094b\u0930\u093f\u0917\u0949\u0928 Porygon\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u043d Porigon\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e42\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e35\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e19 Phorikon\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nBlue's Porygon\nArtificial Pok\u00e9mon\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia\n\n\u2191 \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30de\u30ac64 (Famimaga 64), November 1997 issue (Japanese)\n\n\nExternal links\nTranslation: Satoshi Tajiri cuts loose (1997 interview) - Lava Cut Content \u2014 Full translation of the Famimaga 64 interview, written by Jacob Newcomb and commissioned by Dr. Lava\nDid You Know Gaming: \"7 Pokemon Facts You Never Knew\" \u2014 Features a part of the Famimaga 64 interview that confirmed Porygon's origin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0136: Flareon\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0138: Omanyte\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Porygon_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4124537\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monNormal-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monGender-unknown Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupPink-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 07 Pok\u00e9monMineral group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Sinnoh Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hisui Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 395Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 17 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with cross-generational EvolutionsPok\u00e9mon that evolve through tradingPok\u00e9mon that evolve through held itemsPok\u00e9mon that evolve by trading with a held itemPok\u00e9mon that evolve by trading holding UpgradePok\u00e9mon that run from battleArtificial Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 23 September 2024, at 17:35.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
