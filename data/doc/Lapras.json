It has a blue hide with darker blue spots and a cream-colored underside. It has large brown eyes, a short horn on its forehead, and tightly curled ears. It has a long neck and four flippers. The foremost flippers are larger than the hind. On its back is a heavy, gray shell covered in blunt knobs.\n\n Lapras Paddle\nLapras is a gentle, helpful Pok\u00e9mon that enjoys ferrying people across bodies of water. In the past, its docility made it an easy target for hunters, and it was driven to near extinction. Recent protection efforts have seen Lapras become overabundant instead, which is now affecting the fish Pok\u00e9mon numbers in some areas. An intelligent Pok\u00e9mon, it can understand human speech. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Viva Las Lapras, Lapras has been known to travel in large pods across the seas, spanning both polar and tropical areas. To keep in touch with others of its kind, it sings enchanting melodies. Lapras usually sing when it is in a good mood. In the episode Holiday Hi-Jynx, it's shown that Lapras can develop psychic abilities such as telepathy. In Alola, Lapras is used as a Ride Pok\u00e9mon called Lapras Paddle, Alolan natives use Lapras to travel and fish for Pok\u00e9mon in the water.\n\nForms\nLapras has a Gigantamax form.\nAs Gigantamax Lapras, it becomes larger in size and more armored. Its shell resembles a cruise ship or ocarina with four gray and red stripes surrounding it, and it has four spikes on top of its shell with one steel spike resembling a funnel, which has three red clouds surrounding it. The sclera in Lapras' eyes change colors to white, yellow, and blue. A light blue ring of fine thin lines resembling a musical sheet created from ice particles circles around its shell.\n5,000 people can ride on the shell of Gigantamax Lapras for a very comfortable ride without any issues. Lapras can use its giant ring to break any icebergs that may prevent it from swimming. According to Oleana, Gigantamax Lapras's shell is not part of its body, as the shell has a logarithmic spiral structure.[1]\nGigantamax Lapras is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Resonance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGigantamax Lapras\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness and Explorers of Sky: Lapras is the Pok\u00e9mon that ferries Pok\u00e9mon to the Hidden Land. When Wigglytuff explored the Brine Cave and found the strange marking on the wall there, Lapras asked Wigglytuff not to investigate it further to keep the Hidden Land a secret. During the player's exploration of Brine Cave, the partner's Relic Fragment resonates with a painting in the deepest part of the cave, and this summons Lapras. Lapras ferries the player, the partner, and Grovyle to the Hidden Land, along the way telling the story of what happened when Wigglytuff and Chatot came to Brine Cave. Later, after the player defeats Dialga at Temporal Tower, Lapras will be waiting at the beach and can ferry the player and the partner back to the Hidden Land again. There is no limit to how many times Lapras can do this.\nPok\u00e9mon Super Mystery Dungeon: Lapras runs the Lapras Travel Liner, which allows the player to visit other continents in the world. After the completion of the main story arc, Lapras will be recruitable after the player has established 100 connections.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #131\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nA Pok\u00e9mon that has been overhunted almost to extinction.

Ash caught this Lapras and mostly used it as transportation between the Orange Islands. It was returned to its family in Viva Las Lapras. Ash's Lapras became the leader of the herd in their appearance in Lapras of Luxury.\n\nLapras herd\n The Lapras herd in Pok\u00e9mon the Series\nIn Viva Las Lapras, Ash and his friends located Lapras's school off the coast of Tarroco Island. However, the group wanted nothing to do with Ash's Lapras and they swam away. Later, Ash's group rescued the school from Captain Crook and his crew of Pok\u00e9mon poachers, and Ash's Lapras subsequently returned to the herd.\nIn Lapras of Luxury, Ash and his friends met Naomi, a marine biologist and Lapras expert, near New Bark Town. They also re-encountered Ash's Lapras and its herd as they continued their annual migration from the Orange Islands to the Johto region. Ash's Lapras became the leader of the herd after it defeated Team Rocket, who were attempting to snatch the group. The Lapras herd later left to continue their migration.\n\nLucius's Lapras\nA Lapras appeared in a fantasy in Rivals in the Dark of Night!, where it was revealed to be one of Lucius's Pok\u00e9mon. It made its first physical appearance in Song Within the Mist as the leader of a group of wild Pok\u00e9mon that robbed ships of food while pretending to lead them out of fog. In the next episode, it reentered its Ancient Pok\u00e9 Ball and allowed Liko to take it with her.\n\nLapras (Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky)\nA Lapras took Team Pok\u00e9pals across the Sea of Time in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky - Beyond Time & Darkness.\n\nOther\nLapras made its physical TV debut in Holiday Hi-Jynx under ownership of Santa Claus, where it helped Ash and his friends reunite a Jynx with Santa Claus. This Lapras was able to talk via telepathy.\nIn Snorlax Snowman, two Lapras saved Pikachu and his friends after their ice boat fell apart.\nIn Putting the Air Back in Aerodactyl!, three Lapras appeared whenever Crystal whistles.\nIn May, We Harley Drew'd Ya!, Solidad used a Lapras during the Performance Stage of the Kanto Grand Festival. It was later used in a two-on-two Contest Battle along with Butterfree.\nThree Lapras appeared in Bonnie for the Defense!, including a young Lapras who was being taken care of by Heidi, Kye, and Jay.

Unable to get over his loss, Pryce swore to save his Lapras and thus began researching into time travel, setting the events of the Johto saga in motion. Eventually, Pryce was able to capture Celebi and enter time, only to lose Celebi as the GS Ball containing it was shattered, causing him to be unable to override time any further. However, the baby Lapras, La Glace, was able to enter the time in which Pryce's Lapras were separated, and the family enjoyed a happy reunion while Pryce was eventually lost in time.

The other is Ralts.\nIn Generation II games, a Lapras icon represents Lapras, Seel, or Dewgong at the party screen.\nIn Generation II games, when any Pok\u00e9mon except Pikachu uses Surf to travel over bodies of water, the player appears to be controlling a Lapras. This surfing Lapras shares the same color palette as the player, therefore it is red if the player is male () or blue if the player is female ().\nIn Pok\u00e9mon X and Y, Lapras has a unique 3D model when surfing, whereas all other surfing Pok\u00e9mon are depicted as dark blobs. This may be an homage to the Generation II surfing sprites, or Lapras's role as a means of transport.\nA Shiny Lapras uses the same 3D model as a regular one while surfing.\nIn photos taken at Azure Bay, the player is seen riding a Lapras even if no Lapras is in the party.\nLapras is the only Ice-type to have a Gigantamax form.\nLapras can learn the most one-hit knockout moves of any Pok\u00e9mon (excluding Smeargle), being able to learn Sheer Cold, Fissure, and Horn Drill.\nThe company logos for Surf Shipping and Lapras Shipwrights depict Lapras.\n\n\n\n\nIcon of Surf Shipping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIcon of Lapras Shipwrights\n\n\n\n\nDesign variations\nLapras's appearance has had minor alterations during the early years of the franchise. In the documents for the Capsule Monsters pitch, Lapras was drawn without its curly ears. Furthermore, it was depicted with teeth in its Generation I official artwork and in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly sketch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I art\n\n\n\n\nOrigin\nLapras may be based on the fabled Loch Ness Monster in Scotland. The creature and this Pok\u00e9mon resemble an extinct order of marine reptiles known as Plesiosauria, who lived between the Triassic and Cretaceous periods. Lapras's shell and horn may be inspired by placodonts (close relatives of plesiosaurs that lived during the Triassic period). Its intelligence, singing, and rarity can be comparable to some cetaceans, especially blue whales and humpback whales. Its long neck and robust body may also be inspired by the mastheads and hulls of Viking ships. In addition, its shell, combined with its aquatic nature and history of being hunted to near extinction may be based on sea turtles.\nAs suggested in Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, Lapras could be the turtle ridden by the folklore hero Taro Urashima. This is also implied by its category the transport Pok\u00e9mon along with it often being presented in various pieces of media as a form of transportation across bodies of water.\nGigantamax Lapras may be based on a cruise ship or possibly a music box or ocarina.\n\nName origin\nLapras may be derived from Laplace.\nLaplace may be a reference to Pierre-Simon Laplace, a mathematician who wrote several books on the mathematical properties of the sea and tides. Alternatively, Laplace may be derived from la place (French for seat), referring to how passengers sit on its back like a seat to be ferried across bodies of water.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30e9\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9 Laplace\n\nFrom Pierre-Simon Laplace or la place\n\n\n French\n\nLokhlass\n\nFrom Loch Ness, Laplace, and la classe[2]\n\n\n Spanish\n\nLapras\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nLapras\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Italian\n\nLapras\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub77c\ud504\ub77c\uc2a4 Lapras\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af L\u0101p\u01d4l\u0101s\u012b*\u4e58\u9f8d / \u4e58\u9f99 Ch\u00e9ngl\u00f3ng*\n\nFrom \u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af L\u0101p\u01d4l\u0101s\u012bFrom \u4e58 ch\u00e9ng and \u9f8d / \u9f99 l\u00f3ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af L\u0101aip\u00f3ul\u0101ais\u012b*\u80cc\u80cc\u9f8d Buihbuihl\u00f9hng*\n\nFrom \u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af L\u0101aip\u00f3ul\u0101ais\u012bFrom \u80cc buih and \u9f8d l\u00f9hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Bengali\n\n\u09b2\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09c7\u09b8 Lapras\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05dc\u05e4\u05e8\u05e1 Lapras\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0932\u0948\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938 Lapras\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041b\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0441 Lapras\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Tamil\n\n\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0baa\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bb8 Lapras\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Telugu\n\n\u0c32\u0c3e\u0c2a\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3e\u0c38\u0c4d Lapras\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e25\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e32\u0e0b Laphlat\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nAsh's Lapras\nLapras herd\nLucius's Lapras\nLapras (Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky)\nLapras (UNITE)\nGigantamax\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Assistant \u2014 Pok\u00e9mon: Twilight Wings\n\n\u2191 https://www.liberation.fr/apps/2016/06/pokemon/#item-133o\n\n\nExternal links\nArticle on Wikipedia\n\n Gigantamax forms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0130: Gyarados\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0132: Ditto\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Lapras_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4143070\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monWater-type Pok\u00e9monIce-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Slow experience groupBlue-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 03 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with different formsMonster group Pok\u00e9monWater 1 group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Unova Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 535Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special DefensePok\u00e9mon whose base HP stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon with 19 max performance starsBody size 4 Pok\u00e9monBody size 2 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are not part of an evolutionary lineShadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XDPok\u00e9mon that are included in the Japan-only Pok\u00e9mon Stadium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 11 October 2024, at 14:52.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
