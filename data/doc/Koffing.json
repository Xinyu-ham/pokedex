It has vacant eyes and a wide mouth that usually has two pointed teeth in the upper jaw. However, a full set of teeth is shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Black & White episode Rocking the Virbank Gym! Part 1. Below its face is a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking. Several geyser-like protrusions, which usually release a mustard-colored gas, cover this Pok\u00e9mon's body. Koffing's purple skin is very thin, and over-inflation can cause it to explode. The Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards depicts Koffing as having a hollow body.\nKoffing creates gases within its body by mixing toxins with garbage, and produces more gas in higher temperatures. These gases are malodorous and cause sniffles, coughs, and teary eyes to those around them. The gases are also lighter than air, allowing Koffing to hover. When agitated, it creates a more toxic gas and expels it through the holes in its body. As shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Pok\u00e9mon Emergency!, Koffing's gas can be ignited by fire or electricity. It feeds on the fumes of raw, rotting trash found in gas dumps and polluted air. Koffing at one point was plentiful in Galar due to factories. Koffing is most often found in urban areas.\nKoffing and its evolution, Weezing, are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Neutralizing Gas as an Ability.\n\nEvolution\nKoffing evolves into Weezing.\nIn Galar, it evolves into Galarian Weezing.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nKoffing\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nWeezing\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nWeezingGalarian Form\u00a0Poison\u00a0\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness: Koffing is a member of Team Skull, along with Zubat and the leader Skuntank.

It evolved into Weezing in Dig Those Diglett!.\n\nOther\nIn A Poached Ego!, multiple wild Koffing were captured by Rico. James released his Weezing along with Jessie's Arbok so they could protect these Koffing and a group of captured Ekans.\nIn PK15, a Koffing was one of the occupants of the spooky house.\nIn Tag! We're It...!, Giant used a Koffing in the Hearthome City Tag Battle Competition. Dawn and Conway battled Giant and Koffing alongside their partner and his Scyther. Koffing had several powerful attacks like Sludge Bomb, Thunderbolt, and Gyro Ball, but Conway's Slowking and Dawn's Piplup were able to defeat it.\nIn Rocking the Virbank Gym! Part 1, Roxie used a Koffing during her Gym battle against Ash and proved to be a strong opponent.

When Koga and Blue are ambushed by Agatha's Gengar in Gimme Shellder, Koga uses Koffing's smoke to relay his tactical plan to Blue without Gengar noticing.\nIn Dealing With A Koffing Fit, Petrel, one of the Rocket Executives, attacked Silver and Eusine using the horrible odor induced by his many Koffing.\nA Team Plasma Grunt's Koffing was seen in The Final Battle.\nA Koffing appeared in a flashback in Flab\u00e9b\u00e9 Blooms.\nA Koffing appeared in Goodra Spits, under the ownership of a Team Magma Grunt.\n\nPok\u00e9mon: Yeah!

Koffing did not return in Super Smash Bros. Melee and was replaced by Weezing.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U\nKoffing appears in the 3DS version as an enemy in Smash Run. Its Poison Gas will reduce player's stats.\nIt later reappears in Smash Tour, an exclusive mode for Wii U version. In this mode, Koffing will release Smokescreen, which will obscure all players' view of the board for one turn.\n\n Koffing trophy in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS\nKoffing appears as a trophy in both games.\n\nTrophy information\n3DS: This Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon's balloon-like body is filled with toxic gases. In Smash Run, it floats over to fighters and expels gas at regular intervals. If the gas touches you, the stats you've worked so hard to build up will drop! Attack while it's deflated to take it down safely, and then help yourself to the many, many items it leaves behind.\nWii U: A Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon that looks somewhat like a blown-up balloon. As you might be able to guess, though, it's not filled with fresh air - that's poison gas, and this Pok\u00e9mon isn't shy about sharing. In Smash Tour, the gas it spews will hide spaces and any items that may be on them. The smoke should disappear by the end of the turn.\n\n\nTrivia\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue beta, Koffing was originally known as \"Ny\", representing New York City's polluted air.\nAccording to a Pok\u00e9mon Exam question in Pok\u00e9mon the Series, Koffing was supposedly first discovered in a public bathhouse. However, the Team Rocket expansion's Koffing card states that Koffing was first discovered in a weapons factory. This may be either because Jessie answered the question incorrectly, or due to an inconsistency between the TCG and animated series.\nKoffing and Munna are the only Pok\u00e9mon whose names are mentioned in music found in the games. Munna's name is heard in \u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb\u300c\u30e1\u30ed\u30e1\u30ed\u2605\u30e0\u30f3\u30ca\u300d Musical \"Charming Munna\", while Koffing's Japanese name is heard in \u30bf\u30c1\u30ef\u30ad\u30b8\u30e0(\u6f14\u594f\u30fbDOGARS) Virbank Gym (Performance - KOFFING), although it is replaced with the word \"Pok\u00e9mon\" in international releases.\nThis distinction is possibly shared with Wingull, as its Japanese name, \u30ad\u30e3\u30e2\u30e1 Camome, is arguably heard in the obscure vocals of \u30d3\u30ec\u30c3\u30b8\u30d6\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8 Village Bridge.\nKoffing shares similar traits to Grimer and Trubbish. All three Pok\u00e9mon are pure Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon with a single evolved form, roughly the same base stat totals and evolution levels, and appear to be based on a different kind of pollution; Koffing being air pollution.\nKoffing and its evolved Kantonian form are the only Pok\u00e9mon whose Abilities changed in Generation VIII. In previous generations, their only Ability was Levitate.\nOrigin\nConsidering its looks, its ability to float, and its tendency to explode, Koffing may have been based upon a floating naval mine or living meteorite. It is also based on smog and other forms of air pollution. Koffing may also be based on the imagined fear that heavy pollution, caused by the leakage and/or improper disposal of toxic and/or radioactive waste, may result in the creation of new and undesirable lifeforms. The symbol under its face resembles the skull and crossbones, a hazard symbol for poison.\n\nName origin\nKoffing may be a corruption of coughing.\nDogars may be derived from \u6bd2\u30ac\u30b9 doku-gasu (poison gas).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30c9\u30ac\u30fc\u30b9 Dogars\n\nFrom \u6bd2\u30ac\u30b9 doku-gasu\n\n\n French\n\nSmogo\n\nFrom smog\n\n\n Spanish\n\nKoffing\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nSmogon\n\nFrom Smog and poison\n\n\n Italian\n\nKoffing\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub610\uac00\uc2a4 Ttogas\n\nFrom \ub610 ddo and \ub3c5\uac00\uc2a4 dok-gaseu or gas\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u74e6\u65af\u5f48 / \u74e6\u65af\u5f39 W\u01ces\u012bd\u00e0n\n\nFrom \u74e6\u65af w\u01ces\u012b and \u5f48 / \u5f39 d\u00e0n\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u74e6\u65af\u5f48 Ng\u00e1hs\u012bd\u00e1an*\u6bd2\u6c23\u4e38 Duhkheiy\u00fan*\n\nFrom \u74e6\u65af ng\u00e1hs\u012b and \u5f48 d\u00e1anFrom \u6bd2\u6c23 ng\u00e1hs\u012b and \u4e38 y\u00fan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0915\u0949\u092b\u093c\u093f\u0902\u0917 Koffing\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041a\u043e\u0444\u0444\u0438\u043d\u0433 Koffing\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e42\u0e14\u0e01\u0e32\u0e0b Dokat\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nJames's Koffing\nTeam Skull (Mystery Dungeon)\nPok\u00e9mon fusion\nWeaponry in the Pok\u00e9mon world\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Smash Bros. series\n\n\nGames:\n\nSuper Smash Bros. \u2022 Super Smash Bros.
