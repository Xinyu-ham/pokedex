On its head is a flower with spherical petals surrounded by four reddish-brown leaves. The petals are a dark reddish-brown and have white spots. A female displays a single large spot on each petal, while a male will have many smaller spots. Gloom's eyes are wide and often appear closed and its lips are thin and purple.\nGloom trickles sticky nectar from its mouth with the appearance and consistency of drool. This can be used as a fertilizer for plants. Both this nectar and the flower on Gloom's head release a foul odor strong enough to induce fainting in humans over a mile (1.6 kilometers) away. However, it can also attract prey, and even a very small number of humans find it pleasing. This odor is a key ingredient for some perfume production. When it is in danger, the odor worsens, but it will not emit its odor if it feels safe. Gloom lives in grassy plains. In Generation I, Petal Dance was its signature move.\n\n\nEvolution\nGloom evolves from Oddish and evolves into either Vileplume or Bellossom.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nOddish\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nGloom\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2197\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nVileplume\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2198\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nBellossom\u00a0Grass\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #044\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nThe fluid that oozes from its mouth isn't drool.

Ash first rescued it from the Celadon Gym when it was set on fire due to Team Rocket's actions. Erika first met Gloom when it saved her from a Grimer when she was a girl. According to this episode, Gloom is a very useful Pok\u00e9mon, as Erika uses Gloom's stench as a recipe for creating perfume. It reappeared in flashbacks in Pikachu's Goodbye, the Japanese version of Gotta Catch Ya Later!, and Suffering the Flings and Arrows!.\nIn Make Room for Gloom, Florinda initially wanted to evolve her Gloom into a Vileplume.

It reappeared in a flashback in Bulbasaur... the Ambassador!.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Food Fight!, Gulzar owns a Gloom.

Its brown leaves may also allude to its parasitic origins, as if the flower is drawing nutrients away from Oddish's formerly green leaves and causing them to wilt. Female Gloom resemble Rafflesia hasseltii due to the larger spots on their petals.\nIts tendency to emit a foul odor when it feels threatened is similar to a skunk and comes from Rafflesia's rotting flesh smell. The fact that its pungent pollen can be made into a fragrant perfume may be a reference to musk, an aromatic substance secreted from the glands of various animals that is a common perfume ingredient but smells unpleasant in high concentrations.\n\nName origin\nGloom may be derived from gloom (a state of depression), glue (due to the sticky substance), and bloom. It may also involve glume (a leaf-like structure).\nKusaihana may be derived from \u81ed\u3044\u82b1 kusai hana (stinking flower).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30af\u30b5\u30a4\u30cf\u30ca Kusaihana\n\nFrom \u81ed\u3044\u82b1 kusai hana\n\n\n French\n\nOrtide\n\nFrom ortie and f\u00e9tide\n\n\n Spanish\n\nGloom\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nDuflor\n\nFrom Duft and Flor\n\n\n Italian\n\nGloom\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub0c4\uc0c8\uaf2c Naemsaeko\n\nFrom \ub0c4\uc0c8 naemsae and \uaf43 kkot\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u81ed\u81ed\u82b1 Ch\u00f2uch\u00f2uhu\u0101\n\nFrom \u81ed ch\u00f2u reduplicated and \u82b1 hu\u0101\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u81ed\u81ed\u82b1 Chauchauf\u0101*\u602a\u5473\u82b1 Gwaaimeihf\u0101*\n\nFrom \u81ed chau reduplicated and \u82b1 f\u0101From \u602a\u5473 gwaaimeih and \u82b1 f\u0101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d2\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd Glum\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0917\u094d\u0932\u0942\u092e Gloom\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Icelandic\n\nDrungi*\n\nFrom drungi\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nGl\u016bmius\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0413\u043b\u0443\u043c Glum\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e04\u0e38\u0e44\u0e0b\u0e2e\u0e32\u0e19\u0e30 Khusaihana\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0043: Oddish\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0045: Vileplume\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Gloom_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4129090\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monGrass-type Pok\u00e9monPoison-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Slow experience groupBlue-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 12 Pok\u00e9monGrass group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon with branched EvolutionsPok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hoenn Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 395Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with 19 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with cross-generational EvolutionsPok\u00e9mon that evolve by Evolution stonePok\u00e9mon that evolve using Leaf StonePok\u00e9mon that evolve using Sun StonePok\u00e9mon that lose a type upon evolving\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 22:17.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
