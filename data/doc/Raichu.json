Raichu is covered in dark orange fur with a white belly. Its bifurcated ears are brown on the outside, yellow on the insides, and end in a distinctive curl. There is a circular yellow marking on each cheek where its electric sacs are, and it has a triangular, dark brown nose. Its arms and feet have patches of brown fur at the end, and the soles of its long feet are tan with a circular orange pad in the center. On its back are two horizontal brown stripes. Its long, thin tail has a lightning bolt-shaped end. This lightning bolt is chipped on females. Raichu exudes a weak electrical charge from its body and glows slightly in the dark.\nRaichu's tail is used to gather electricity from the atmosphere, or it can be planted in the ground to search for electricity. It also protects Raichu from its high-voltage power. Raichu can store over 100,000 volts of electricity, enough to knock out a Copperajah. If Raichu's sacs are fully charged, its ears will stand straight up, and its muscles will become stimulated. However, it will become aggressive if it has stored too much electricity and stress. To prevent it from reaching this state, it discharges electricity through its tail into the ground. This leads to scorched patches near its nest. Being the result of evolution via Evolution stone, Raichu is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in forests and woodlands. The main reason Raichu is rarely seen with Pok\u00e9mon trainers is because people prefer the look it had as Pikachu. As revealed in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Electric Shock Showdown, Raichu is not capable of learning speed attacks upon evolving and can only learn them when they're still Pikachu. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Raichu is known to sleep while discharging electricity, and a long tail is planted into the ground like a rod. It can electrocute anyone who comes near it while sleeping.[1]\nRaichu and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Volt Tackle.\n\nForms\n Alolan Raichu are rarely seen on the ground, preferring to float on their tails\u2014typical hodad behavior\n Alolan Raichu standing off of its tail in Pok\u00e9mon the Series\nRaichu has a regional form: Alolan Raichu.\nIn Alola, Raichu has lighter coloring and more rounded features. Its eyes are blue with yellow half-circles along the bottom. It has large yellow ears with an inner spiral toward the base and brown on the inside. These ears are thicker and less pointed than a standard Raichu's ear. In addition to its white belly, Alolan Raichu has white markings on its paws with bright yellow lines between its digits. The stripes on its back have also turned white, and there is a small, white circular marking on each heel. The lightning bolt-shaped tip of its tail has rounded edges. By collecting its psychic power in its tail, it can ride it like a surfboard and float in the air. While its cheek sacs are still used to store electricity, rubbing them releases a sweet aroma while also getting a light shock. This is also thought to be connected to its Psychic abilities.\nAlolan Raichu's origins were initially a mystery at the time. The people of Alola suggested it ate too many sweet and fluffy pancakes,[2] especially those made with a secret Alolan recipe. However, researchers believe the change is related to Alolan Raichu's diet in general. It is also believed the weather and climate of the Alola region played a role in the transformation. Alolan Raichu is capable of unleashing star-shaped thunderbolts. It is also known by the name hodad. While normally found in Alola, it was been seen in the Coastal Biome of the Terarium during rare Mass outbreak events.\nAlolan Raichu is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Stoked Sparksurfer. It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Surge Surfer as an Ability.\n\nEvolution\nRaichu evolves from Pikachu and is the final form of Pichu.\nIn Alola, Raichu has a regional form that evolves from Pikachu and is the final form of Pichu in the Alola region.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nPichu\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPikachu\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\u2197\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nRaichu\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2198\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nRaichuAlolan Form\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team: Raichu is part of an unnamed rescue team which gathers at Pok\u00e9mon Square just before the player and partner are able to access Magma Cavern.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #026\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nIts long tail serves as a ground to protect itself from its own high voltage power.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nWhen electricity builds up inside its body, it becomes feisty.

Surge's Raichu appeared in a fantasy in Toughing It Out!.\n\nIn the TCG\nMain article: Raichu (TCG)\nIn the TFG\nOne Raichu figure has been released.\n\nNext Quest: Raichu\nOther appearances\n Alolan Raichu in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nAlolan Raichu appears as a Pok\u00e9mon summoned from the Pok\u00e9 Ball. It attacks with Surge Surfer, surfing with its tail across the stage and damaging passersby with electricity.\n\n\nTrivia\nNo other Pok\u00e9mon has the same type combination as Alolan Raichu.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, there is a Scientist at the Pok\u00e9mon Lab in Cinnabar Island who will trade a Raichu for an Electrode. If the player talks to him after the trade, he will mention that the Raichu evolved, which is not possible. This mistake was due to the original translation of the script of the Japanese Blue (in which this person traded a Graveler for a Kadabra) rather than that of Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green. This error was corrected in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen, as the script was re-translated.\nRaichu's FireRed and Sun Pok\u00e9dex entries discuss Raichu's electricity being able to knock out an Indian elephant. In Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus, this is changed to Copperajah, which is based on the Indian elephant.\nThis is also the only Pok\u00e9dex entry in Legends: Arceus to mention a Pok\u00e9mon not obtainable in Hisui.\nSeveral Pok\u00e9dex entries claim Raichu can discharge up to 100,000 volts. However, its Stadium entry claims it can only discharge up to 10,000 volts. This is likely a translation error due to the way numbers are read in Japanese, where 100,000 literally reads \"ten ten-thousands\".\nAlthough Pikachu is the first partner Pok\u00e9mon of Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, it is not possible to directly evolve it into Raichu in the game, and must be traded in from Red and Blue. This inability to evolve Pikachu is a reference to Ash's Pikachu in Pok\u00e9mon the Series.\nRaichu and its pre-evolved form both share their category with Rattata, Raticate, Sandshrew, Sandslash, Pawmi, and Pawmo. They are all known as the Mouse Pok\u00e9mon, though Rattata and Raticate were originally called the Rat Pok\u00e9mon prior to Generation III.\nRaichu is the 26th Pok\u00e9mon in both the National Pok\u00e9dex and Alola Pok\u00e9dex in Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon.\nAlolan Raichu is the only regional form Pok\u00e9mon to have a Z-Move exclusive to it.\nRaichu is the most common Pok\u00e9mon found amongst rivals, being used by five of them.\nAlolan Raichu is the only Alolan form available in Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet that can only be obtained by transferring from other games, outside of Pok\u00e9 Portal News events.\nConcept and development\nRaichu and Alolan Raichu were designed by Atsuko Nishida.[3] The concept of Alolan Raichu came from Masafumi Nukita, which also involved writing its Pok\u00e9dex entries.[4]\nRaichu originally had an evolved form named \"Gorochu\" (Japanese: \u30b4\u30ed\u30c1\u30e5\u30a6 Goroch\u016b), which would have had two horns and fangs.[5][6] Ken Sugimori stated that while there was nothing wrong with its appearance, it was nonetheless omitted from Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green, as the staff found that the game balance was better without it, and the limited game space meant that some Pok\u00e9mon originally designed to evolve twice were changed to evolve only once.[7]\n\nOrigin\nRaichu's legs and long tail resemble those of a jerboa or kangaroo rat.\nAlolan Raichu may be based on the concept of surfing Pikachu and the sport of surfing itself, which originated in Hawaii (the inspiration for the Alola region), as well as the hodad concept of being a fake surfer; hodad is referred to as another name for Alolan Raichu in its Pok\u00e9dex entry in Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun. Its design and Psychic typing may have been influenced by Puka, a surfing Pikachu that appeared in Pok\u00e9mon the Series which had psychic powers and blue eyes. In the Pok\u00e9mon Stadium series, Colosseum, XD, and Battle Revolution, Raichu rides on its tail when using the move Surf.\nAccording to Ken Sugimori, he asked Atsuko Nishida to design Alolan Raichu since she was the one who had worked on the original Raichu design. Nishida insisted that Raichu \"has always been cuter than people might think\", and designed Alolan Raichu to emphasize Raichu's cuteness; in particular, she designed it with the motif of bread. The in-game lore of people believing that its evolution is induced by eating pancakes was added afterward to play up the concept.[3] The fact that Alolan Raichu was designed after bread may have also inspired the sweet fragrance it can release from its cheeks, as well as the look of its paws which resemble whipped cream decorations, cream puffs, or baozi.\n\nName origin\nRaichu may be a combination of \u96f7 rai (thunder) and \u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc ch\u016bch\u016b (onomatopoeia for the squeak of a mouse).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30e9\u30a4\u30c1\u30e5\u30a6 Raichu\n\nFrom \u96f7 rai and \u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc ch\u016bch\u016b\n\n\n French\n\nRaichu\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Spanish\n\nRaichu\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n German\n\nRaichu\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Italian\n\nRaichu\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub77c\uc774\uce04 Raichu\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u96f7\u4e18 L\u00e9iqi\u016b\n\nFrom \u96f7 l\u00e9i and the transcription of Japanese name\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u96f7\u4e18 L\u00e8uihy\u0101u*\u96f7\u8d85 L\u00e8uihch\u012bu*\n\nFrom \u96f7 l\u00e9i and the Mandarin-based transcription of Japanese nameFrom the transcription of Japanese name while incorporating \u96f7 l\u00e9i and \u8d85 ch\u012bu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05e6'\u05d5 Ra'eechu\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0930\u093e\u0907\u091a\u0942 Raichu\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nRai\u010diu\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0420\u0430\u0439\u0447\u0443 Raychu\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e44\u0e23\u0e0a\u0e39 Raichu\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nLt.
