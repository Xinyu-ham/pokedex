Its top half is white, while its lower half is red. The Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards depict Electrode as hollow.\nElectrode tends to live in power plants where fresh electricity is being generated, which it consumes. As a result, it often causes blackouts. The more electric energy Electrode consumes, the faster it moves. When full of stored electricity, it has been known to drift with the wind.\nElectrode explodes in response to even the smallest stimulation, simply to entertain itself, or because it has taken in too much electricity. However, unlike Voltorb, Electrode can control its explosive ability at will. This unpredictable and explosive nature has earned it the nickname of \"Bomb Ball\". Because of its appearance, many Trainers try to pick Electrode up, mistaking it for an item.\n\nForms\nElectrode has a regional form: Hisuian Electrode.\nIn Hisui, Electrode also resembles an upside-down Pok\u00e9 Ball, specifically one of its time period, with a wooden upper half and a glossy, dark red lower half with a hole in the bottom. Its eyes are large black holes inside a debossed pattern, resembling an angry glare. Its mouth is in a constant frown, giving the impression that it is drawn on. Interestingly, its surface texture is similar to that of an Apricorn.\nWhen enraged, Hisuian Electrode can unleash an electric current equivalent to about twenty lightning bolts. It can absorb and store chlorophyll energy along with electricity. Electrode can release this energy through the hole on its lower half. It can also climb up trees.\nHisuian Electrode is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Chloroblast.\n\nNoble Pok\u00e9mon\nA special Hisuian Electrode is worshipped by the Hisui people due to it being descended from one of the ten ancient Pok\u00e9mon who received a blessing from Arceus despite the fact that Pok\u00e9 Balls had not yet been invented. In particular, it is one of the Noble Pok\u00e9mon who resides in the Coronet Highlands, watched over by the Warden Melli.\n\nEvolution\nElectrode evolves from Voltorb.\nHisuian Electrode evolves from Hisuian Voltorb.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nElectrode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nVoltorb\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nElectrode\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHisuian Electrode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nVoltorbHisuian Form\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Grass\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nElectrodeHisuian Form\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Grass\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearance\nPok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus: Hisuian Electrode is a supporting character and boss in the game.

Surge.\n\nIn the TCG\nMain article: Electrode (TCG)\nOther appearances\n An Electrode in Super Smash Bros. Brawl\nSuper Smash Bros./Melee/Brawl/3DS and Wii U/Ultimate\nIn the original Smash Bros. Electrode would appear from the doorway atop the Silph Co. building on the Saffron City stage and use Explosion, damaging any players near it. In the sequels, it would be released randomly from a Pok\u00e9 Ball. When released, Electrode will pause for a few seconds before using Explosion. It can be picked up and thrown, though this is risky as Electrode will hurt everyone near it, including the player who threw the Pok\u00e9 Ball. Electrode functions in Brawl in much the same way as in Melee; however, sometimes, it will fail to explode. Other times, Electrode will merely pretend to fail to explode, then explode suddenly after a few seconds. Electrode appears in the fourth and fifth installments, retaining its behavior from Brawl.\n\nMelee trophy information\nElectrode, an electric Ball Pok\u00e9mon, is the evolved form of Voltorb. It has the tendency to explode with even the slightest provocation, which has earned it the nickname \"Wrecking Ball.\" Electrode is the quickest Pok\u00e9mon found to date, and its distinctive white-over-red coloring is the opposite of Voltorb's.\n\nBrawl trophy information\n\"A Ball Pok\u00e9mon. The more electricity stored in its body, the quicker it moves. One danger of storing that much electricity is the slightest stimulus may cause it to explode. Moves it specializes in are Selfdestruct and Explosion. Its love of electricity cause it to gather near power plants.\"\n\n3DS/Wii U trophy information\n Electrode trophy in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS\nNA: An Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon that stores energy inside its body. Nicknamed \"the Bomb Ball\" by some, the slightest shock risks setting this Pok\u00e9mon off. If you're feeling brave, you can throw Electrode at your foes before it detonates. Handle with care, or it'll go off in your hands instead! \nPAL: This Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon stores huge amounts of electricity in its body. It is also known as the Bomb Ball due to the fact that even the lightest touch can make it blow up. Sometimes it takes a little while for Electrode to use its Explosion attack, so you might have enough time to throw it in someone else's direction! Feeling brave?\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nElectrode appears as a Spirit.\n\n\nTrivia\nIn Red, Blue, FireRed, and LeafGreen, players can obtain an Electrode at a level as low as 3 by catching a Pikachu in Viridian Forest, evolving it, and trading it to an old man at Cinnabar Island's Pok\u00e9mon Lab.\nElectrode has a short song dedicated to it, sung by Suzukisan.\nElectrode is the only non-playable Pok\u00e9mon to use the same move in Pokk\u00e9n Tournament and the Super Smash Bros. series.\nThe author of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, Hidenori Kusaka, uses Electrode to represent himself in the volume's comment boxes.\nHisuian Electrode has the highest base Speed stat of all Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nOrigin\nElectrode seems to be based on the concept of a living Pok\u00e9 Ball, and is often mistaken for one. As such, its design is likely inspired by gashapon capsules, which often consists of a white half and a vibrant colored half. The idea of Voltorb and Electrode being mistaken for the standard Pok\u00e9 Balls that represent items is similar to a mimic, a monster archetype commonly found in RPGs. Its Shiny coloration is possibly based on a Great Ball.\nElectrode may also be based on a ball lightning, as hinted by its spherical shape, type, explosive behavior, and tendency to drift on wind. Based on its Japanese name and its explosive tendencies, Electrode may have some connection to land mines or bombs.\nThe expressions on both Electrode and Voltorb may be a personification of the positive and negative charges associated with electric charge. For their original forms, Voltorb has a negative angry look, where Electrode has a positive happy look. The polarity of these expressions, or charges, are reversed for their Hisuian forms.\nHisuian Electrode and its Grass typing may be based on the fact that Pok\u00e9 Balls were originally made from Apricorns, which may be based on Japanese chestnut or acorns. It may also be based on traditional Japanese fireworks: they are spherical in shape, with shells made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, charges inside that are often made with rice husks, and a hole where the fuse goes. This can be seen in the TCG and its statue at the Temple of Sinnoh, which all depict it emitting blasts from a hole on its bottom to launch itself.
