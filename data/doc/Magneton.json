Prior to Generation II, it was a pure Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nIt evolves from Magnemite starting at level 30 and evolves into Magnezone when leveled up in a special magnetic field or when exposed to a Thunder Stone.\n(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data for these details.)\nThe Paradox Pok\u00e9mon Sandy Shocks is said to be an ancient relative of Magneton.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biology\n\n1.1 Evolution\n\n\n2 Game data\n\n2.1 Pok\u00e9dex entries\n2.2 Game locations\n\n2.2.1 In side games\n\n\n2.3 Held items\n2.4 Stats\n\n2.4.1 Base stats\n2.4.2 Pok\u00e9athlon stats\n\n\n2.5 Type effectiveness\n2.6 Learnset\n\n2.6.1 By leveling up\n2.6.2 By TM\n2.6.3 By breeding\n2.6.4 By a prior Evolution\n2.6.5 TCG-only moves\n\n\n2.7 Side game data\n2.8 Evolution data\n2.9 Sprites\n\n2.9.1 Other sprites\n\n\n\n\n3 In animation\n\n3.1 Main series\n\n3.1.1 Major appearances\n\n3.1.1.1 Clemont's Magneton\n3.1.1.2 Other\n\n\n3.1.2 Minor appearances\n3.1.3 Pok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n3.2 Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2 Animated Trailer\n3.3 Pok\u00e9mon Generations\n3.4 GOTCHA!\n3.5 Pok\u00e9mon Evolutions\n\n\n4 In the manga\n\n4.1 Pok\u00e9mon Ranger: The Comic \u2013 Shadows of Almia\n4.2 Pok\u00e9mon Adventures\n4.3 Pok\u00e9mon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys\n4.4 Pok\u00e9mon Pocket Monsters\n4.5 Pok\u00e9mon Ranger the Comic: Double Mission\n4.6 Pok\u00e9mon Zensho\n\n\n5 In the TCG\n6 Other appearances\n\n6.1 Super Smash Bros.

Each individual Magnemite has a gray spherical body with a single eye, and a gray and red-and-blue tipped horseshoe magnet on each side. The topmost Magnemite has three Phillips head screws on its body, while the others appear to have only two. The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked in several ways. Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked by the screws on the bottom, forming a triangle. In some cases, commonly seen in 3D games such as Pok\u00e9mon Snap, the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remain in a triangular formation at rest, and are able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. In this case, all three Magnemite have three screws. The magnetic forces that hold the three Magnemite together are powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature by 3.6\u00a0\u00b0F (2\u00a0\u00b0C) within a radius of 3,300 feet (one kilometer). It can also be disruptive to electronic devices and induce earaches. It uses powerful radio waves to help it study the surrounding area.\nMagneton's anti-gravitational powers enable it to fly through the air. Being composed of three Magnemite, it is about three times as powerful electrically, though not three times as intelligent. Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still has the need to eat. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Pok\u00e9 Spokesman, food for Magneton consists of electrical currents. It is usually found in rough terrain, often near power plants.\nWhen sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. When rain clouds form, it also gathers in high areas prone to lightning strikes. As seen in the eleventh chapter of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series episode The Future I Choose, it can cause interference with phone and internet signels. In An Unexpected Picnic!, a herd of Magneton can produce an EMP that can destroy computer software. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting Magneton have been discovered at the Ruins of Alph. One was shown in the Pok\u00e9mon Generations episode The Redemption in a flashback to the great war of Kalos, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. Additionally, Sandy Shocks bears a strong resemblance to Magneton. It is believed to be an ancient Magneton that was alive 10,000 years ago. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Magneton is known to sleep with its three linked Magnemite either stuck together or drifting apart by a strong magnetic force.[1] It is theoried that its magnetism is unstable while Magneton sleeps.\n\nEvolution\nMagneton evolves from Magnemite and evolves into Magnezone.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nMagnemite\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nMagneton\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nMagnezone\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #082\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nFormed by several Magnemites linked together.

Magneton cannot evolve into Magnezone in Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, due to there being no area in Kanto or Johto with a special magnetic field. Magneton also cannot evolve in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, as Magnezone is not present in those games. There is also no special magnetic field in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield or Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet, so from Generation VIII onwards, Magneton is also able to evolve into Magnezone when exposed to a Thunder Stone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nMagnemite\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\nLevel 30\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nMagneton\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n + Level upin areas with aspecial magnetic field\u2192Thunder StoneVIII+\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nMagnezone\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\nSprites\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed\n\nGreen\n\n\n\nRed\n\nBlue\n\n\n\nYellow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGold\n\n\n\nSilver\n\n\n\nCrystal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration III\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuby\n\nSapphire\n\n\n\nEmerald\n\n\n\nFireRed\n\nLeafGreen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration IV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiamond\n\nPearl\n\n\n\nPlatinum\n\n\n\nHeartGold\n\nSoulSilver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack\n\nWhite\n\n\n\nBlack 2\n\nWhite 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration VI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nY\n\n\n\nOmega Ruby\n\nAlpha Sapphire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration VII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSun\n\nMoon\n\n\n\nUltra Sun\n\nUltra Moon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\nFront\n\nBack\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's Go, Pikachu!\n\n\n\nLet's Go, Eevee!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration VIII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegends: Arceus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-Generation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For other sprites and images, please see Magneton images on the Bulbagarden Archives.\nOther sprites\n\n\n\n\n\nJolt in Pok\u00e9mon Super Contests\n\nIn animation\nMain series\n Magneton in Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series\n Shiny Magneton in Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Gold and Silver\nMajor appearances\nClemont's Magneton\nClemont owns a Magneton, which he keeps at the Lumiose Gym so Clembot can use it for Gym Battles while Clemont is away.

Ultimate\nMagneton appears as a Spirit.\n\nTrivia\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue beta, Magneton was originally known as \"Recoil\".\nMagneton and its pre-evolved form were the first Pok\u00e9mon to ever change types with the progress of generations.\nAlthough it is said that Magneton is made up of three Magnemite, there is contradictory evidence seen in various forms of media.\nIn the only animated episode to date showing a Magnemite Evolution, Get Along, Little Pok\u00e9mon, when Ethan's Magnemite #6 evolves into Magneton, it \"creates\" two Magnemite during Evolution, instead of combining with two real Magnemite. Similarly, in the main series games, when Magnemite reaches level 30, it evolves without the aid of two additional Magnemite. This is unlike Mantyke, which requires a Remoraid to evolve.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Snap, a Magneton is clearly shown to be created by three Magnemite. Also, when two Magnemite get stuck together halfway through Evolution in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team, they mention how three Magnemite must come together to evolve.\nAfter Evolution, Magneton becomes exactly ten times heavier than Magnemite. Logically, it should be three times heavier due to it being three Magnemite (39.6\u00a0lbs). Magnemite weighs 13.2\u00a0lbs. (6.0\u00a0kg), whereas Magneton weighs 132.3\u00a0lbs. (60.0\u00a0kg).\nMagneton is usually depicted with only seven screws, with two of the Magnemite losing one screw each upon Evolution. However, it is occasionally depicted with 9 screws such as in its Generation II and Generation III sprites.\nThe 3 Magnemite composing Magneton are usually depicted as attached to each other and only occasionally separating. However, in certain games such as Pok\u00e9mon Stadium and Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum, the Magnemite are depicted as floating separately from each other and only occasionally combining to attack.\nMagneton and Magnemite are two of few Pok\u00e9mon that had their cry changed slightly in Generation III. This was due to Generation III utilizing a better sound effects game engine and newer game system.\nDespite most depictions of Magneton showing they are able to float through the air, Magneton does not have the Ability Levitate, so it is still affected by Ground-type moves. However, starting in Generation IV, Magneton can learn Magnet Rise, which simulates Levitate for five turns.\nMagneton is the only Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon consisting of multiple bodies.\nMagneton is the only Pok\u00e9mon to share its weight with any of its Paradox relative species, weighing the same as Sandy Shocks.\nIt is also the only Pok\u00e9mon with an ancient relative that is not heavier than its present-day relative.\nOrigin\nMagneton is a cluster of three Magnemite, which in turn seems to be based on the objectification of electromagnetism, one of the four fundamental interactions of nature. They are likely linked through strong electromagnetic force.\n\nName origin\nMagneton may be derived from magneton (various units of magnetic moment) or possibly magnetron (high-power vacuum tube).\nRarecoil may be a combination of rare-earth magnet and electromagnetic coil.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30ec\u30a2\u30b3\u30a4\u30eb Rarecoil\n\nFrom rare-earth magnet and electromagnetic coil\n\n\n French\n\nMagn\u00e9ton\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Spanish\n\nMagneton\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nMagneton\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Italian\n\nMagneton\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub808\uc5b4\ucf54\uc77c Rarekoil\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u4e09\u5408\u4e00\u78c1\u602a S\u0101nh\u00e9y\u012bc\u00edgu\u00e0i\n\nFrom \u4e09\u5408\u4e00 s\u0101n-h\u00e9-y\u012b, \u78c1 c\u00ed, and \u602a gu\u00e0i\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u4e09\u5408\u4e00\u78c1\u602a S\u0101amhahpy\u0101tch\u00echgwaai\n\nFrom \u4e09\u5408\u4e00 s\u0101am-hahp-y\u0101t, \u78c1 ch\u00ech, and \u602a gwaai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092e\u0948\u0917\u094d\u0928\u0947\u091f\u0949\u0928 Magneton\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041c\u0430\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043d Magneton\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e41\u0e23\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e25\u0e4c Raekhoi\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nClemont's Magneton\nPok\u00e9mon fusion\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0081: Magnemite\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0083: Farfetch'd\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Magneton_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4129103\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monElectric-type Pok\u00e9monSteel-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monGender-unknown Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupGray-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 11 Pok\u00e9monMineral group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hoenn Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Sinnoh Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Unova Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hisui Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 465Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon whose base Special Attack stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon whose base Special stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon with 18 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monShadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XDSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with cross-generational EvolutionsPok\u00e9mon that evolve by training in a certain locationPok\u00e9mon that evolve by training in a special magnetic fieldPok\u00e9mon that evolve by Evolution stonePok\u00e9mon that evolve using Thunder StonePok\u00e9mon that are included in the Japan-only Pok\u00e9mon StadiumPok\u00e9mon that have had their type changed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 22:25.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
