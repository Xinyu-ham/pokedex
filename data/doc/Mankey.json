It is bipedal and has a round body covered in whitish, shaggy fur. Its nose is similar to a pig's snout, and it has narrow, red eyes and triangular ears with brown insides. Mankey's three-fingered hands, two-toed feet, and the tip of its curved, prehensile tail are brown.\nMankey specializes in physical fighting and is very aggressive and short-tempered. When angry, it begins shaking and its breathing turns rough. Its rage peaks quickly, preventing its victim from being able to flee. It will rampage until it falls asleep, but its anger remains in its dreams. This causes it to wake up and become furious all over again. However, this constant release of stress grants it a long life. Mankey can be found in the mountains, where it lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason. If it loses sight of its colony or if it is left alone to rage, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated.\nAccording to the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team games, Mankey's preferred food is chestnuts. However, Mankey usually lacks the dexterity to peel them. It becomes agitated and rage after attempting to peel a chestnut's spiky shell. Additionally, it also appears to be fond of bananas, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Showdown at the Po-k\u00e9 Corral. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, it is rare to find a Mankey sleeping without an angry look on its face.[1]\n\nEvolution\nMankey evolves into Primeape, which evolves into Annihilape.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nMankey\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPrimeape\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nAnnihilape\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\u00a0Ghost\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Three Mankey are the boss of Uproar Forest. After being defeated, they follow the player back to the rescue base. The Mankey help with the remodeling of the base but go on strike half-way through until they receive two peeled chestnuts.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness: A Mankey and a Primeape can be found in the Hot Spring.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #056\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nExtremely quick to anger.

Both of them are Generation I Pok\u00e9mon who evolve into their evolved forms at level 28. Mankey is exclusive to Pok\u00e9mon Red, Gold, HeartGold, and Let's Go Pikachu!, while Meowth is exclusive to Blue, Silver, SoulSilver, and Let's Go Eevee!. Also, in Black\u00a02 and White\u00a02, Yancy will trade the player a Meowth if the player is male, and Curtis will trade Mankey if the player is female.
