It has two round white eyes with tiny black pupils. Its enormously long red tongue is used to burrow itself into the sand to sleep overnight and also to lure and capture prey. The tongue protrudes even when its shell is closed and tugging it will cause the shell to pop open. Its soft and tender body is well-protected by its extremely durable shell, which is purported to be harder than diamonds and has historically been used by people to make shields. It can make pearls from accumulated sand, though it discards them as they are typically in its way.\nShellder has an unusually strong appetite for the tail of a Slowpoke and can develop a symbiotic relationship with the Dopey Pok\u00e9mon. After attaching itself to the Slowpoke's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and evolve into Slowbro together. Alternatively, if it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a King's Rock, the two will instead evolve into Slowking. These relationships allow it to travel onto land and begin a new stage in its life cycle. In Galar, Shellder attaches to the forearms and heads of Galarian Slowpoke wearing Galarica Cuffs or Galarica Wreaths, causing the evolution into Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking, respectively.\nRegardless of which form the two Pok\u00e9mon evolve into, Shellder's shell transforms into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, Shellder will have a red jewel on its underside and a large horn on either side of its shell.\nWhile in its crown form, Shellder will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain. This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pok\u00e9mon's intelligence to increase. Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and Shellder is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns. However, Shellder's poison makes Slowbro more sluggish as it continues to drain nutrients from its host's body. As seen in Slowking's Crowning! and An Evolution in Taste!, the crown form of Shellder can take control of humans who wear it and speak through its hoist. The control of Shellder wears off the moment the crown is removed.\nDespite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts. Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort. It swims around its seafloor home by rapidly opening and closing its shell while facing backward. Despite its appearance, Shellder is surprisingly fast. Prehistoric Shellder were apparently preyed upon by Omastar, whose powerful bites were capable of breaking through its shell. Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, are related to Shellos and Gastrodon. Kingler, Rufflet, and Bruxish are modern predators of Shellder.\nPrior to Generation III, Clamp was its signature move. Prior to Generation V, Icicle Spear was also its signature move, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding. Additionally, prior to Generation V, Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Skill Link as an Ability.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttached to Slowbro\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttached to Mega Slowbro\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttached to Galarian Slowbro\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttached to Slowking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttached to Galarian Slowking\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nShellder evolves into Cloyster.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nShellder\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nCloyster\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Ice\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: Three Shellder appear on the Red Table and give the player points when hit.

Shellder clamps onto a Slowpoke's tail to evolve into Slowbro, or onto its head while wearing the King's Rock to evolve into a Slowking. Even though Shellder changes form drastically when it bonds with Slowpoke to evolve (see above), it is not considered an evolution in and of itself.\nDespite this requirement for Slowpoke to evolve, no game has ever reflected this beyond Slowpoke's Pok\u00e9dex entries. Slowpoke instead evolves into Slowbro at level 37, and into Slowking while traded with a King's Rock, and does not require the presence of Shellder, as opposed to Mantyke evolving with Remoraid in the party.\nShellder is said to produce poison and inject it into its host Slowbro or Slowking, but is not actually capable of learning any Poison-type moves as of Generation VIII.\nIn The Evolution Solution, it is revealed that Shellder is still capable of speech as the shell of a Slowbro.\nShellder were revealed to be capable of floating through the air in Pok\u00e9mon Snap, a trait that has been seen in no other media.\nShellder and Cloyster share their category name with Clamperl. They are all known as the Bivalve Pok\u00e9mon.\nShellder can be seen as a counterpart to Staryu. Both are Water-types in the Water 3 Egg Group, both evolve with a Water Stone, and both gain a second type upon evolution. Cloyster is seen as a slow defensive Pok\u00e9mon, while Starmie is seen as a fast attacking Pok\u00e9mon; and Shellder is exclusive to FireRed and Y, while Staryu is exclusive to LeafGreen and X.\nOrigin\nShellder is similar to a clam, with its tongue representing a clam's \"foot\". Its ability to move by flapping its shell is likely inspired by scallops. Scallops are also related to the thorny oysters that resemble its evolved form. The fact that it latches onto Slowpoke and produces a beneficial toxin may be inspired by leeches.\n\nName origin\nShellder may be derived from shell and possibly shelter.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b7\u30a7\u30eb\u30c0\u30fc Shellder\n\nFrom shell and possibly shelter\n\n\n French\n\nKokiyas\n\nFrom coquillage\n\n\n Spanish\n\nShellder\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n German\n\nMuschas\n\nFrom Muschel and Wasser\n\n\n Italian\n\nShellder\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc140\ub7ec Sellor\n\nSimilar to the Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5927\u820c\u8c9d / \u5927\u820c\u8d1d D\u00e0sh\u00e9b\u00e8i\n\nFrom \u5927 d\u00e0, \u820c sh\u00e9, and \u8c9d / \u8d1d b\u00e8i\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5927\u820c\u8c9d D\u00e0sh\u00e9b\u00e8i*\u8c9d\u6bbc\u602a Buihokgwaai*\n\nFrom \u5927 d\u00e0, \u820c sh\u00e9, and \u8c9d b\u00e8iFrom \u8c9d\u6bbc buihok and \u602a gwaai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0936\u0947\u0932\u094d\u0921\u0930 Shellder\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0428\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0434\u0435\u0440 Shellder\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e25\u0e40\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c Cheldoe\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nPok\u00e9mon fusion\nGalarian form\nSlowpoke\nSlowbro\nSlowking\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0089: Muk\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0091: Cloyster\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Shellder_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4140227\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monWater-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Slow experience groupPurple-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 01 Pok\u00e9monWater 3 group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 305Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with 14 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monShadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XDPok\u00e9mon that evolve by Evolution stonePok\u00e9mon that evolve using Water Stone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 6 October 2024, at 17:26.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
