It has narrow, red eyes and two fangs in its upper jaw. On the tip of Rhydon's snout is a cream-colored horn, which is smaller on a female than on a male. There are several other spikes and projections on its head: on top is a spike that curves forward, two triangular points resembling ears on the sides, a wide, wavy crest under each ear, and spiky ridges on each cheek. It has a cream-colored abdomen divided into strips by thin divots. A rocky plate on its chest slightly overlaps its abdomen. There is a row of spikes down its back and they have a long tail with thin, black stripes.\nRhydon is a physically powerful Pok\u00e9mon. It is recorded as being able to topple buildings with a sweeping blow of its tail, and its horn can bore through solid rock and shatter diamonds. Rhydon sharpens their horns by clashing them together. Its armor-like hide protects it from heat and physical blows. It is stated to be capable of passing unscathed through streams of magma (3,600 degrees Fahrenheit) and withstanding a direct blow from a cannonball without being harmed. However, because of this tough hide, it is insensitive. Despite its well-developed brain, it can be forgetful. Rhydon lives in rough terrain like in caves or on top of mountains. Due to its Evolution allowing Rhydon to walk on two legs, it can expand its territory to more than a Rhyhorn's original habitat limit.\n\n\nEvolution\nRhydon evolves from Rhyhorn and evolves into Rhyperior.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nRhyhorn\u00a0Ground\u00a0\u00a0Rock\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nRhydon\u00a0Ground\u00a0\u00a0Rock\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nRhyperior\u00a0Ground\u00a0\u00a0Rock\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team: Rhydon leads an unnamed rescue team which gathers at Pok\u00e9mon Square just before the player and partner are able to access Magma Cavern.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #112\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nProtected by an armor-like hide, it is capable of living in molten lava of 3,600 degrees.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nWalks on its hind legs.

It briefly battled Charizard, who then refused to battle. While normally tough against Electric attacks, Rhydon was defeated when Pikachu struck Rhydon's horn, which acted like a lightning rod. It reappeared in a flashback in Volcanic Panic.\nIn The Battle of the Badge, Giovanni loaned his Rhydon to Jessie, James, and Meowth while putting them in charge of the Viridian Gym. It was subsequently used in their battle against Ash, where it was defeated by Pidgeotto and then Pikachu.\nIn Bound For Trouble, a giant Rhydon was living on Fairchild Island. Its size was due to the excessive amount of available food on the island.\nIn Right On, Rhydon!, a Rhydon unique for its strength and its ability to know Surf was sought by Pietra, but she needed a surfing Pok\u00e9mon to accomplish this task. Pietra eventually caught Rhydon after rescuing it from Team Rocket.\nIn Tag! We're It...!, a Scientist used a Rhydon during the Hearthome City Tag Battle Competition. Pikachu and Chimchar battled it and a Magmar belonging to an Ace Trainer. Rhydon had Lightning Rod, which left Pikachu's Electric attacks useless, but Pikachu was able to defeat Rhydon with Iron Tail.\nIn Bibarel Gnaws Best!, the head engineer used a Rhydon to drill out rocks for a bridge under construction, but it was attacked by a Bibarel. When Bibarel was cornered, Ash's Pikachu used Iron Tail to defeat Rhydon.\nIn Meloetta and the Undersea Temple!, a Team Rocket Grunt used a Rhydon and a Golem to capture Meloetta, but they were stopped by Ridley and his Golurk. Though the full battle wasn't shown onscreen, Rhydon was apparently defeated by Golurk.\nIn A Crackling Raid Battle!, Jessie pulled a Rhydon from the Rocket Prize Master and used it in a Raid Battle against Zapdos.\nIn The Pendant That Starts It All (Part One), a Rhydon appeared under the ownership of Zirc.

It managed to defeat Arbok, but it is unclear if it won against Gengar as well, for the outcome of that battle was never shown onscreen. Whatever the case, Blue eventually managed to defeat Agatha, allowing him to progress to Lance's room.\nTwo soldiers' Rhydon appeared in The Redemption, during a fantasy of a story from the past. They were seen petrified after the ultimate weapon was used by AZ to end the great war of Kalos 3,000 years previously.\n\nPok\u00e9mon: Twilight Wings\n Rhydon in Pok\u00e9mon: Twilight Wings\nIn Letter, a Rhydon was with Bea.\nIn Training, a Rhydon was in the Wild Area.\n\nGOTCHA!\nA Rhydon briefly appeared in GOTCHA!, under the ownership of Blue.\n\n\nIn the manga\nAsh & Pikachu\nSimilar to her animated series counterpart, Pietra recently caught a Rhydon.

It was forced to evolve by its Trainer with a mysterious injection, being the first evolution shown in the manga due to Red's Poliwhirl and Blue's Charmander evolving off-panel at the time.\nLater in Tauros the Tyrant, a Team Rocket Grunt used a Rhydon in an attempt to catch Green.\nIn A Tale of Ninetales, a wild Rhydon attacked two of Blue's fan girls.\nA Rhydon appeared in Long Live the Nidoqueen!?, under the ownership of Giovanni. He used its Fissure to trap Red.\nIn How Do You Do, Sudowoodo?, Gold encounters a wild Rhydon during his race with Whitney. It was hunting down a Sudowoodo, and kidnapped Whitney when she interfered with her Miltank, breaking her arm in the process. Gold tells Sudowoodo to stand up for itself and, with assistance from his billiard cue, helps Sudowoodo defeat the Rhydon with a strong punch to the gut.\nIn Rock, Paper...Scizor, Blue catches a Rhydon outside the Viridian Gym. He uses him to defeat Chuck in Heckled by Hitmontop, as well as Orm in Don't Doubt Deoxys. Near the end of the FireRed and LeafGreen saga, Blue remarks on a footnote Giovanni included in his handbook: Rhydon possibly possessed a stronger form. This is a reference to Rhydon's new evolved form, Rhyperior, an evolution that succeeded in occurring thanks to Silver's knowledge of Pok\u00e9mon trading, resulting in the same Rhydon, as Rhyperior, being on hand with him until being returned to Blue later on.\nA Rhydon appeared in Deprogramming Porygon-Z, under the ownership of an Ace Trainer.\nA Trainer's Rhydon appeared in Clobbering Claydol.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys\nA Rhydon appeared in Let's Aim For The Goal!.\nA Trainer's Rhydon appeared in Let's Fight For The Future!!.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Pocket Monsters\nGiovanni has a Rhydon, which he used in his Gym battle against Red in Get The Last Badge!!.\nA Rhydon appeared in The Ancient Pok\u00e9mon Discovery!.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Zensho\nGiovanni's Rhydon was Satoshi's opponent for his final Gym battle in PZ09. It went up against his Charizard and was defeated.\n\nIn the TCG\nMain article: Rhydon (TCG)\nTrivia\n Early sketches of Rhydon\nAccording to interviews with Ken Sugimori, Rhydon was one of the first Pok\u00e9mon ever created;[1][2] this is evidenced by early sketches of the Capsule Monsters game concept featuring Rhydon, Lapras, and others. Moreover, Rhydon's index number is 001 in Generation I.\nSince Rhydon's index number is 001 in Generation I, a glitch Pok\u00e9mon with an index number of 000 or that is greater than 152 will revert to Rhydon when its Pok\u00e9dex entry is viewed.\nAsh's Pikachu fought Blaine's Rhydon in Pok\u00e9mon the Series and defeated it by aiming an electric attack at its horn, despite it being a Ground-type immune to Electric attacks. This particular scene spawned a popular, albeit misquoted, internet meme where \"aim for the horn!\" is commonly attributed to this episode. Rhydon's horn serving as a lightning rod for electric attacks would also become an ability in Generation III.\nRhydon and its evolved form share their category name with Nidoqueen and Nidoking. They are all known as the Drill Pok\u00e9mon. Additionally, all four are partly Ground-types.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus, Rhyhorn and Rhydon cannot learn Thunderbolt, even though they were able to in all other games in which Thunderbolt could be learned outside of leveling up.\nOrigin\nRhydon was created with a Kaiju motif.[1][2] Its design appears to draw inspiration from a rhinoceros and some aspects of various dinosaurs, such as ceratopsids. Its horn may be based on drills.\n\nName origin\nRhydon may be a combination of rhinoceros, rhyolite (a type of rock, referring to its Rock type), and don (Spanish for lord) or -don (common suffix in dinosaur names derived from the Ancient Greek word for tooth).\nSaidon may be a combination of \u7280 sai (rhinoceros) and don.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9\u30f3 Saidon\n\nFrom \u7280 sai and don\n\n\n French\n\nRhinof\u00e9ros\n\nFrom rhinoc\u00e9ros and f\u00e9roce\n\n\n Spanish\n\nRhydon\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nRizeros\n\nFrom Rhinozeros\n\n\n Italian\n\nRhydon\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ucf54\ubfcc\ub9ac Koppuri\n\nFrom \ucf54\ubfd4\uc18c koppulso\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u947d\u89d2\u7280\u7378 / \u94bb\u89d2\u7280\u517d Zu\u00e0nji\u01ceox\u012bsh\u00f2u*\u9435\u7532\u66b4\u9f8d / \u94c1\u7532\u66b4\u9f99 Ti\u011bji\u01ceb\u00e0ol\u00f3ng*\n\nFrom \u947d / \u94bb zu\u00e0n, \u89d2 ji\u01ceo, \u7280 x\u012b, and \u7378 / \u517d sh\u00f2uFrom \u9435\u7532 / \u94c1\u7532 ti\u011bji\u01ce and \u66b4\u9f8d / \u66b4\u9f99 b\u00e0ol\u00f3ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u947d\u89d2\u7280\u7378 Jyungoks\u0101isau*\u9435\u7532\u66b4\u9f8d Titgaapbouhl\u00f9hng*\n\nFrom \u947d jyun, \u89d2 gok, \u7280 s\u0101i, and \u7378 sauFrom \u9435\u7532 titgaap and \u66b4\u9f8d bouhl\u00f9hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5\u05df Rhydon\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0930\u093e\u0907\u0921\u0949\u0928 Rhydon\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0420\u0430\u0439\u0434\u043e\u043d Raydon\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e44\u0e0b\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e19 Saidon\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nBlue/Silver's Rhydon\nReferences\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 (2001). \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30fb\u30de\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u3008VOL.4\u3009\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc/\u30a4\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u7de8 (English translation by Shmuplations)\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 (July 2000). \u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u300f\u958b\u767a\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30d5\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc (\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\uff42)\u3002 Nintendo Online Magazine (N.O.M).
