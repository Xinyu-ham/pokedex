It is the final form of Bulbasaur.\nVenusaur has two forms: Mega Venusaur and Gigantamax Venusaur. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Venusaur using the Venusaurite, and can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Venusaur if it has the Gigantamax Factor. Gigantamax Venusaur was introduced in The Isle of Armor.\nVenusaur is the game mascot of Pok\u00e9mon Green and its remake Pok\u00e9mon LeafGreen, appearing on the box art of both games.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biology\n\n1.1 Forms\n1.2 Evolution\n\n\n2 Game data\n\n2.1 NPC appearances\n2.2 Pok\u00e9dex entries\n2.3 Game locations\n\n2.3.1 In side games\n2.3.2 In events\n\n2.3.2.1 Wild Area News\n2.3.2.2 Pok\u00e9 Portal News\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Held items\n2.5 Stats\n\n2.5.1 Base stats\n\n2.5.1.1 Venusaur\n2.5.1.2 Mega Venusaur\n\n\n2.5.2 Pok\u00e9athlon stats\n\n\n2.6 Type effectiveness\n\n2.6.1 Venusaur\n2.6.2 Mega Venusaur\n\n\n2.7 Learnset\n\n2.7.1 By leveling up\n2.7.2 By TM\n2.7.3 By breeding\n2.7.4 By a prior Evolution\n\n\n2.8 Side game data\n\n2.8.1 Venusaur\n2.8.2 Mega Venusaur\n\n\n2.9 Form data\n\n2.9.1 Mega Evolution\n2.9.2 Gigantamax\n\n\n2.10 Evolution data\n2.11 Sprites\n\n2.11.1 Other sprites\n\n\n\n\n3 In animation\n\n3.1 Main series\n\n3.1.1 Major appearances\n\n3.1.1.1 May's Venusaur\n3.1.1.2 Other\n\n\n3.1.2 Minor appearances\n3.1.3 Pok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n3.2 Pok\u00e9mon Origins\n3.3 GOTCHA!\n3.4 Pok\u00e9mon Evolutions\n\n\n4 In the manga\n\n4.1 Pok\u00e9mon Adventures\n\n4.1.1 Major appearances\n\n4.1.1.1 Saur\n\n\n4.1.2 Minor appearances\n\n\n4.2 Pok\u00e9mon Pocket Monsters\n4.3 The Electric Tale of Pikachu\n4.4 Pok\u00e9mon Zensho\n4.5 Movie adaptations\n4.6 Pok\u00e9mon: Yeah!

It has small, circular red eyes and a short, blunt snout. Its mouth is wide with two pointed teeth in the upper jaw and four in the lower jaw. On top of its head are small, pointed ears with reddish-pink insides. It has three clawed toes on each foot. The bud on its back has bloomed into a large pink, white-spotted flower. The flower is supported by a thick, brown trunk surrounded by green fronds. A female Venusaur has a gynoecium in the center of its flower.\nVenusaur uses its flower to catch the sun's rays to convert them into energy, which causes the flower to become more vibrant. The flower releases a soothing scent that attracts Pok\u00e9mon and calms emotions. This scent becomes stronger after a rainy day. Venusaur is at its strongest in the summertime when there is much more sunlight to absorb. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Venusaur releases a soothing fragrance while sleeping. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Bulbasaur's Mysterious Garden, Venusaur has demonstrated the ability to manipulate nature, release several vines from its back, and lead evolution ceremonies for Bulbasaur and Ivysaur. This Pok\u00e9mon is rarely found in the wild, but it has been known to inhabit grasslands.\n\n\nForms\n Gigantamax Venusaur using G-Max Vine Lash\nVenusaur has two forms: Mega Venusaur and Gigantamax Venusaur.\nWhen Mega Evolved, the flower on Venusaur's back grows more prominent, and two smaller pink flowers bloom, one on its forehead and one on its rear. Its legs and back have become sturdier to support the extra weight of the flower. Additional leaves with woody stems, supported by vines, are also grown around the flower. Mega Venusaur also develops dark markings on its forehead below the new flower on its forehead.\nAs Gigantamax Venusaur, it becomes larger with its flower blooming even further, covering its body. These flowers have a taller bud and extraordinarily thick, springy petals capable of shielding Gigantamax Venusaur. Its eyes have light green sclerae and orange irises. More foliage grows from under its flower, and the trunk supporting it becomes shorter. It has several light green markings located at its belly.\nGigantamax Venusaur attacks with its thick vines, which are powerful enough to topple down a 10-story building. Gigantamax Venusaur's flower can similarly spread enough pollen to resemble a volcanic eruption. Breathing in this pollen can cause uncontrollable sneezing, and inhaling large amounts can even cause fainting. However, this pollen also promotes plant growth in areas where it lands.[1]\nGigantamax Venusaur is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Vine Lash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMegaVenusaur\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGigantamaxVenusaur\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nVenusaur evolves from Ivysaur and is the final form of Bulbasaur.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nBulbasaur\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nIvysaur\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nVenusaur\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9Park Wii: Pikachu's Adventure: Venusaur is the leader of the Meadow Zone.

Venusaur will occasionally fire Razor Leaves at any character in front of it.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Melee\nWhen Venusaur is released from a Pok\u00e9 Ball, it uses the move Earthquake (which Venusaur couldn\u2019t learn until Generation III), which acts similarly to Donkey Kong's Down Special. Any player caught in this will be sent flying.\nVenusaur is also a part of the stage in Pok\u00e9 Floats. The front half will push itself onto the screen first will begin to move to the left after Snorlax leaves the screen.\n\nTrophy information\nEvolving from Ivysaur, this deceptively toxic Pok\u00e9mon has a huge flower on its back that emits a cloying fragrance: the scent lulls its enemies into a state of calmness. Venusaur's flower synthesizes sunshine into pure energy for its SolarBeam move. Think of Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon, and Venusaur comes first.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Brawl\nVenusaur is briefly mentioned in Ivysaur's trophy description.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U\n Mega Venusaur trophy in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS\nMega Venusaur appears as a trophy in both versions of the game.\n\nTrophy information\nWith a special type of Mega Stone called Venusaurite, Venusaur can Mega Evolve into Mega Venusaur in the middle of a battle.

Now, that's got to be intimidating!\n\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nVenusaur reprises its role as a stage element in the returning Saffron City stage. It is also a Spirit.\n\nPOK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu\nTwo Venusaur appeared in POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu.\n\nPok\u00e9mon UNITE\n Venusaur in Pok\u00e9mon UNITE\nMain article: Venusaur (UNITE)\nVenusaur is playable through obtaining a Unite License. It is a ranged attacker that starts as Bulbasaur and evolves into Ivysaur at level 5, which evolves into Venusaur at level 7.\n\n\nTrivia\nVenusaur shares its height (6'7\"/2.0 m), weight (220.5\u00a0lbs./100.0\u00a0kg) and Egg Groups (Monster and Grass), with another Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon, Tropius.\nVenusaur's evolutionary line is the only first partner Pok\u00e9mon evolutionary line to have the Poison type.\nVenusaur's evolutionary line is also the only first partner Pok\u00e9mon evolutionary line to have each member appear at least once in the Super Smash Bros. series.\nVenusaur is among Ken Sugimori's favorite Pok\u00e9mon. However, it is also his least favorite Pok\u00e9mon to draw due to its complex design.[2]\nVenusaur's number in the National Pok\u00e9dex and the Fiore Browser are the same: 003.\nDue to the censor that prevents Pok\u00e9mon with offensive nicknames being traded on the GTS, a Venusaur with an English name could not be traded on the GTS without a nickname in Generation V.\nVenusaur shares its category with its pre-evolved forms and Sunkern. They are all known as the Seed Pok\u00e9mon.\nIf the player chooses Charmander as their first partner Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, or locks themselves out of receiving Bulbasaur in Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, it is impossible to get Venusaur registered in the Pok\u00e9dex without trading, as no NPC in said games uses a Venusaur under this condition. In Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen, Cooltrainer Albert uses a Venusaur in Knockout Mode at the Trainer Tower.\nIn Red and Blue, the only way to see Venusaur without owning one is to choose Squirtle as a first partner Pok\u00e9mon, in which case Blue will have one starting at Silph Co onwards.\nVenusaur is the first Pok\u00e9mon in National Pok\u00e9dex order to have gender differences.\nVenusaur is the only Pok\u00e9mon to be the Game mascot for an Japanese exclusive Core series game.\nMerchandise\n Venusaur in Pok\u00e9mon Battle Chess\nVenusaur appears in Pok\u00e9mon Battle Chess. It behaves like the rook piece in chess.\nOrigin\nAccording to Ken Sugimori in a Japanese interview discussing the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, Venusaur and its pre-evolutions were inspired by frogs.[3] In particular, its short legs, stout appearance, ear-like protrusions on its head, and the Thick Fat Ability on Mega Venusaur, together make it resemble horned frogs. Unlike Bulbasaur, Venusaur's \"ears\" have hollows, indicating that they are in fact ears and not glands, as seen in many species of frogs and toads.\nThe flower on its back resembles the Rafflesia arnoldii.\n\nName origin\nVenusaur may be a combination of Venus (referring to the Venus flytrap plant) or venom and dinosaur.\nFushigibana may be a combination of \u4e0d\u601d\u8b70 fushigi (strange; mysterious) and \u82b1 hana (flower).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30d5\u30b7\u30ae\u30d0\u30ca Fushigibana\n\nFrom \u4e0d\u601d\u8b70 fushigi and \u82b1 hana\n\n\n French\n\nFlorizarre\n\nFrom flore and bizarre\n\n\n Spanish\n\nVenusaur\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nBisaflor\n\nFrom bizarr, Saurier, and Flora or flor\n\n\n Italian\n\nVenusaur\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc774\uc0c1\ud574\uaf43 Isanghekkot\n\nFrom \uc774\uc0c1\ud558\ub2e4 isanghada and \uaf43 kkot\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5999\u86d9\u82b1 Mi\u00e0ow\u0101hu\u0101\n\nFrom \u5999 mi\u00e0o, \u86d9 w\u0101, and \u82b1 hu\u0101\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5999\u86d9\u82b1 Miuhw\u0101f\u0101*\u5947\u7570\u82b1 K\u00e8ihyihf\u0101*\n\nFrom \u5999 miuh, \u86d9 w\u0101, and \u82b1 f\u0101From \u5947\u7570 k\u00e8ihyih and \u82b1 f\u0101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Bulgarian\n\n\u0412\u0438\u043d\u044a\u0437\u043e\u0440 Vin\u016dzor\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05e0\u05d0\u05d6\u05d5\u05e8 Vinasaur\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0935\u0940\u0928\u093e\u0938\u0949\u0930 Venusaur\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nVenuzauras\n\nFrom English name\n\n\n Brazilian Portuguese\n\nVenossauro\n\nFrom Venus and dinossauro\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0412\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0440 Venuzavr\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e1f\u0e38\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e01\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e19\u0e30 Fuchikibana\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nMay's Venusaur\nSaur\nVenusaur (UNITE)\nFirst partner Pok\u00e9mon\nMega Evolution\nGigantamax\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Gigantamax Venusaur | Official Website | Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield\n\n\u2191 https://web.archive.org/web/20101230153442/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/sp/index4.html\n\n\u2191 Page 4 of interview with Game Freak, hosted on Nintendo's official website (Japanese, archived)\n\n\nExternal links\nArticle on Wikipedia\n\n Mega Evolutions \nIntroduced in Pok\u00e9mon X and Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduced in Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: Primal Reversion \u2022 Bond Phenomenon \u2022 Ultra Burst\n\n\n Gigantamax forms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Smash Bros. series\n\n\nGames:\n\nSuper Smash Bros. \u2022 Super Smash Bros.
