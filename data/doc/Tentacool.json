It has a light blue, clear body with two large, transparent, red, eye-like crystals on each side of its body and one small one in the middle. Near the base of its body is a pointed, beak-like projection and two eyes with small pupils. There are two grayish tentacles extending from beneath its round lower body, which has a cape-like formation on the back.\nTentacool's entire body is made of 99% water, and the remaining 1% contains the organ that produces its poison. It absorbs sunlight and refracts it using the water inside its body to convert it into beam energy. Its tentacles are laced with stinging cells and, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Tentacool & Tentacruel, it can control Pok\u00e9mon it touches with its tentacles. The tentacles break off occasionally, but they can regenerate. The poison from its tentacles is so potent, that someone would need to be immediately rushed to the hospital. Tentacool is not a very strong swimmer, traveling throughout the world using ocean currents. Tentacool searches for food while drifting on the surface of shallow seas. Tentacool can blend in the water, making it very difficult to spot. It will sometimes wash ashore and shrivel up due to dehydration, though it remains equally as dangerous. Tentacool may be revived if thrown back into the sea.\nTentacool is mistakenly believed to be a species relative of Toedscool; in actuality, the two Pok\u00e9mon are biologically unrelated.\n\nEvolution\nTentacool evolves into Tentacruel.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nTentacool\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nTentacruel\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #072\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nDrifts in shallow seas.

The fact that it has only two tentacles may be based on the Tentaculata class of comb jellies, most of which are known for having a pair of long tentacles that are used to catch prey. It might also be based on the squid.\nTentacool also resembles several varieties of the bug-eyed monster and other alien invaders from 1950s B-movies, which is reflected in its ability to fire lasers from the gems on its head.\n\nName origin\nTentacool may be a combination of tentacle and cool. It may also involve Tentaculata (class of comb jellies).\nMenokurage may be a combination of \u76ee\u306e\u6575 me no kataki (enemy) or \u76ee\u306e\u6bd2 me no doku (temptation, literally \"poison to the eye\") and \u6c34\u6bcd kurage (jellyfish).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\nThis section is incomplete.Please feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it.
