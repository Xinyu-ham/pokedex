Each \"head\" has a slightly different facial expression, but each face has triangular eyes with tiny black pupils and a small mouth. Each shell has some cracks, and one member of the bundle usually has its yellow insides or brain exposed. More numerous cracks are a sign that it is close to evolution. Despite looking like eggs, Exeggcute is actually more closely related to plant seeds. It is believed to carry genes of plants and other species.\nExeggcute gather in swarms of six. The heads communicate with each other by using a form of telepathy that only they can understand. Should the number of Exeggcute be reduced to less than six, the remaining Exeggcute will attempt to replace it with a similarly sized Pok\u00e9mon as seen in the Pikachu short Pikachu's Rescue Adventure. It needs six Exeggcute in order to stay balanced or else it becomes nervous and cowardly. Pidgeotto and Crabrawler are its natural predators, which it chases off with psychokinesis. Exeggcute inhabits jungles and forests. Exeggcute in the Alola region tend to be heavier than those from elsewhere. This is due to the shells being packed full.\nExeggcute and its evolved form, Exeggutor, are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Barrage.\n\nEvolution\nExeggcute evolves into Exeggutor.\nIn Alola, it evolves into Alolan Exeggutor.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nExeggcute\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nExeggutor\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nExeggutorAlolan Form\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Dragon\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #102\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nOften mistaken for eggs.

They are both known as the Egg Pok\u00e9mon.\nDespite being able to learn Solar Beam by level up, Exeggcute cannot learn it by TM in Generation I.\nDespite consisting of six individuals from different births and having separate identities, all six merge during Evolution to form a single Exeggutor.[1]\nExeggcute and Kantonian Exeggutor are the only Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon in the Grass Egg Group.\nThe size and crack patterns on the \u201cleader\u201d Exeggcute is inconsistent between games. In Red and Blue only, the \u201cleader\u201d is disproportionately larger compared to any other games which has it relatively consistent in size. The crack pattern is absent on the \u201cleader\u201d in all the Generation IV and V sprites while there is an additional lower crack under its left eye in Pok\u00e9mon Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald. In its Dream World and official art, the crack is absent.\nOrigin\nExeggcute may be based on both plant seeds and a clutch of eggs. It may also draw inspiration from coconuts, considering Exeggutor's resemblance to a palm tree and the fact that Exeggcute is hunted by Crabrawler, which may be based on a coconut crab. It is possibly a visual pun on an eggplant, though it may also have been inspired by the \"Egg Yolk\" tomato, or the bird's nest fungi. Their Psychic type may come from the idea of telepathy making them coordinate and act as one being.\n\nName origin\nExeggcute may be a combination of execute, egg, and cute.\nTamatama may be derived from \u7389\u5b50 tamago (egg), as well as being a play on \u5076\u3005 tamatama (unexpectedly).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30bf\u30de\u30bf\u30de Tamatama\n\nFrom \u7389\u5b50 tamago and \u5076\u3005 tamatama\n\n\n French\n\nNoeunoeufNoeufnoeuf*N\u0153ufn\u0153uf*\n\nFrom \u0153uf repeatedMisspelling of NoeunoeufMisspelling of Noeunoeuf\n\n\n Spanish\n\nExeggcute\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nOwei\n\nFrom ovum and Ei, as well as being a play on O wei!\n\n\n Italian\n\nExeggcute\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc544\ub77c\ub9ac Arari\n\nFrom \uc54c al\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u86cb\u86cb D\u00e0nd\u00e0n\n\nFrom \u86cb d\u00e0n repeated\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u86cb\u86cb Daahndaahn\n\nFrom \u86cb daahn repeated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u090f\u0917\u094b\u0932\u093e Eggola\n\nFrom egg and \u0917\u094b\u0932\u093e gola\n\n\n Icelandic\n\nAfl\u00edfa*\n\nFrom afl\u00edfa\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u042d\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043a\u044c\u044e\u0442 Eksegk'yut\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e17\u0e32\u0e21\u0e30\u0e17\u0e32\u0e21\u0e30 Thamathama\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\u2191 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krm9t6tk3Nc A scene from Pok\u00e9mon the Series featuring an evolving Exeggcute.\n\n\nRelated articles\nPok\u00e9mon fusion\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0101: Electrode\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0103: Exeggutor\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Exeggcute_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128715\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monGrass-type Pok\u00e9monPsychic-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Slow experience groupPink-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 11 Pok\u00e9monGrass group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon with branched EvolutionsPok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 325Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with 16 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that evolve by Evolution stonePok\u00e9mon that evolve using Leaf StonePok\u00e9mon with cross-generational EvolutionsPok\u00e9mon that only evolve in AlolaPok\u00e9mon that lose a type upon evolving\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 16:25.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
