Its round body is covered with small bumps and it has a rocky crest above its small eyes and mouth. It has four arms, each with a three-fingered hand. Its second pair of arms is typically kept tucked against its chest. It was shown in Pok\u00e9mon Snap that, despite having legs, it can revert to a legless form. This grants it the ability to float.\nGraveler's preferred locomotion is rolling, specifically, because it is a slow walker. It often rolls down mountain paths at high speeds exceeding 60 mph, crushing objects in the way and stopping by running into huge rocks should it build up too much speed. However, it will explode if it rolls into a river instead. Graveler is known to be generally free and uncaring, not minding if pieces of itself break off, as it can restore itself over time. Graveler climbs a mountain from base to summit, feasting on rocks all the while. Graveler's favorite rock to eat is moss-covered rocks. It regularly consumes tons of moss-covered rocks and makes loud noises while eating. Upon reaching the peak, it rolls down to the bottom. Graveler live in horizontal holes that they gouge out in sheer cliff faces, and they are capable of withstanding volcanic temperatures. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Graveler is known to rock back and forth while sleeping.[1] It is believed that Graveler is dreaming about rolling down hilly paths.\n\nForms\nGraveler has a regional form: Alolan Graveler.\nIn the Alola region, Graveler looks similar to its regular counterpart, but with a silvery sheen. It lacks defined digits on its upper limbs and has two toes on each foot rather than three. There are several small, yellowish crystals scattered across its body and iron sand attracted by magnetism. This black sand creates crystal-like formations above its eyes, across the tops of the upper pair of arms, and on the sides of its face.\nAlolan Graveler has a very quick-tempered personality. Alolan Graveler feeds on dravite, which creates the yellow crystals on its body and grants it electrical abilities. It often fights with others over food, and when two smash together, it creates a flash of light and a booming sound; for this reason, people refer to it as \"the fireworks of the earth\". Similar to its Kantonian counterpart, Alolan Graveler rolls down mountain paths; however, instead of flattening obstacles as it rolls, it sends them flying by zapping them with electricity. They can also be found in the Canyon Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated.\nAlolan Graveler and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Galvanize as an Ability.\n\nEvolution\nGraveler evolves from Geodude and evolves into Golem.\nAlolan Graveler has a dual-type Rock/Electric regional form. It evolves from Alolan Geodude and evolves into Alolan Golem.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nGraveler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nGeodude\u00a0Rock\u00a0\u00a0Ground\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nGraveler\u00a0Rock\u00a0\u00a0Ground\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nGolem\u00a0Rock\u00a0\u00a0Ground\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlolan Graveler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nGeodudeAlolan Form\u00a0Rock\u00a0\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nGravelerAlolan Form\u00a0Rock\u00a0\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nGolemAlolan Form\u00a0Rock\u00a0\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team: Two Graveler are members of Team Rumblerock.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky: At the start of the Special Episode Here Comes Team Charm!, a Graveler is about to claim some treasure in an old set of ruins, but is beaten to it by Team Charm.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #075\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nRolls down slopes to move.

It reappeared in Pok\u00e9mon Ranger the Comic: Double Mission Episode Four and was released in Pok\u00e9mon Ranger the Comic: Double Mission Episode Five.\n\nIn the TCG\nMain article: Graveler (TCG)\nOther appearances\nPOK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu\nA Graveler appeared in POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu.\n\nTrivia\nGraveler's Crystal sprite is different from that of Gold and Silver, making it one of few Pok\u00e9mon to have three distinctly different sprites in Generation II.\nGraveler's Red and Blue sprite shows an incorrect number of limbs; only four are visible. This was corrected in Pok\u00e9mon Yellow.\nMato's rendition of the Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures also depicts Yellow's Graveler with four limbs, possibly for this reason. All other Graveler that have since appeared in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures have shown the right amount.\nGraveler is the only Pok\u00e9mon unavailable for use in the Pika Cup who can evolve, despite the fact that Golem is available.\nGraveler is very similar to Boldore. Both are Rock-type Pok\u00e9mon introduced in an odd-numbered generation with a base stat total of 390, have Sturdy as one of their Abilities, evolve at level 25, and can evolve again by trading.\nGraveler's evolutionary line is the only three-stage evolutionary line in which all members have a regional form.\nAlolan Graveler and its evolutionary relatives were designed by Hitoshi Ariga.[2]\nBurmy, Wormadam, Mothim, Geodude, Graveler and Golem are the only Pok\u00e9mon in all five Hisui Pok\u00e9dex sublistings.\nIn Generation IX, Kantonian Graveler cannot learn Gyro Ball via TM, while its evolutionary relatives can.\nOrigin\nGraveler appears to be based on a living boulder, and thus it may be based on a earth elemental creature like golem. Its four arms may be based on Hindu gods such as Shiva or Vishnu. It could also have been inspired by the tsuchikorobi, a Japanese y\u014dkai known as the \"tumbling monster\", for its habit of rolling over travelers and crushing them, as Graveler does.\nAlolan Graveler seems to have dark structures made of piezoelectric crystals or magnetite, a subset of iron ore known for its black crystalline appearance and magnetic properties. This iron ore takes shape of Graveler's eyebrows. The golden gems may be also inspired by piezoelectric materials or by amber and its electrostatic characteristics. This could possibly be an allusion to \u1f24\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u0113lektron (Ancient Greek for amber).\n\nName origin\nGraveler may be a combination of gravel and traveler.\nGolone may be a combination of \u30b4\u30ed\u30f3\u30b4\u30ed\u30f3 goron-goron (onomatopoeia of rolling rocks) and stone.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b4\u30ed\u30fc\u30f3 Golone\n\nFrom \u30b4\u30ed\u30f3\u30b4\u30ed\u30f3 goron-goron and stone\n\n\n French\n\nGravalanch\n\nFrom gravats and avalanche\n\n\n Spanish\n\nGraveler\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nGeorok\n\nFrom geo- or Geode and rock\n\n\n Italian\n\nGraveler\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub370\uad6c\ub9ac Deguri\n\nFrom \ub370\uad74\ub370\uad74 deguldegul\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u9686\u9686\u77f3 L\u00f3ngl\u00f3ngsh\u00ed\n\nFrom \u9686\u9686 l\u00f3ngl\u00f3ng and \u77f3 sh\u00ed\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u9686\u9686\u77f3 L\u00f9hngl\u00f9hngsehk*\u6efe\u52d5\u77f3 Gw\u00e1nduhngsehk*\n\nFrom \u9686\u9686 l\u00f9hngl\u00f9hng and \u77f3 sehkFrom \u6efe\u52d5 gw\u00e1nduhng and \u77f3 sehk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0948\u0935\u0932\u0930 Graveler\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0440 Graveler\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e42\u0e01\u0e42\u0e25\u0e19 Kolon\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nRegional form\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 Tweet by \u3042\u308a\u304c\u3072\u3068\u3057/ArigaHitoshi (@ariga_megamix).
