It has large, vacant eyes and pink lips. Its pectoral and tail fins are white. On its back is a stiff, three-peaked yellow fin, resembling a crown; there is an identical fin on its underside. It also has long barbels. The barbels are white on a female and pale-yellow on a male. A long-lived Magikarp is able to utilize its immense splashing power to leap high enough to scale mountains. It also has a strong enough immune system to survive in the most polluted of waters. However, it is usually overlooked by Trainers because of its perceived weakness: even in the heat of battle, it will do nothing but flop around. It is believed that the ancestors of Magikarp were actually much stronger than modern Magikarp, and this led scientists to research this species.\nMagikarp is found in many bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. However, due to its weak swimming ability, it usually lives downstream of the water's flow. In Generation I, Splash was its signature move. It is often seen using Splash to leap out of the water, which makes it an easy target for predators such as Pidgeotto and Pidgeot. Frillish is also known to prey on Magikarp.\nIn Hoppy Town, there are at least 31 unique pattern varieties of Magikarp, with their scales coming in colors such as gray, black, white, purple, pink, violet, apricot, and brown. These patterns can be classified by groups, depending on how the Magikarp looks while it is still small; a specific pattern arises when it becomes bigger. Which patterns can be caught depend on the type of Old Rod; the better the rod, the more groups of patterns can be fished. The people in Hoppy Town train their Magikarp to jump the highest in order to compete in a series of Leagues to win prizes.\n\nEvolution\nMagikarp evolves into Gyarados.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nMagikarp\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nGyarados\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nMagikarp is the focus of the mobile game Pok\u00e9mon: Magikarp Jump. The player can fish for many patterns of Magikarp, then train their Magikarp and compete with others to see whose Magikarp can jump the highest.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #129\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nIn the distant past, it was somewhat stronger than the horribly weak descendants that exist today.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nFamous for being very unreliable.

In Pok\u00e9mon Platinum, Magikarp can be found at levels ranging from level 1 to 100 in the Resort Area, and in Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2, it can be found at the same levels in the Nature Preserve; both require a Super Rod.\nFurthermore, Magikarp can be encountered at level 100 in the rightmost lake of Fellhorn Gorge in Kitakami.\nMagikarp and its evolved form require the fewest Egg cycles to hatch, with five.\nMagikarp and its evolved form are also the only Pok\u00e9mon with a unique base Egg cycle.\nMagikarp was the first Pok\u00e9mon featured in Professor Oak's Pok\u00e9mon Lecture in EP061.\nMagikarp and its evolved form's Egg Group combination (Water 2 and Dragon) is unique.\nMagikarp is one of fourteen Pok\u00e9mon that one could collect foreign Pok\u00e9dex entries for in Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl.\nMagikarp shares several notable similarities to Feebas:\nIts level-up moves are exactly the same as those of Feebas.\nHowever, Feebas can learn multiple moves from TMs and HMs, hatch from an Egg with Egg Moves, and learn new moves via Move Tutors, making it slightly more useful in battle.\nMagikarp shares its category name with Feebas. They are both known as the Fish Pok\u00e9mon.\nMagikarp and Feebas have almost identical stats. However, Magikarp has a higher Special Attack and Defense, while Feebas has a higher Attack and Special Defense. Both Attack and Defense stats for Magikarp and Feebas are reversed.\nThey share the largest base stat total increase of all Pok\u00e9mon when they evolve: 340 (from 200 to 540).\nThey both change appearances drastically after evolution, evolving into serpentine, dragon-like Pok\u00e9mon.\nMagikarp has the lowest base Attack stat of all Water-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nMagikarp is also tied with Caterpie, Weedle, Igglybuff, Carvanha, Attack Forme Deoxys, and Stonjourner for having the lowest base Special Defense stat of all Pok\u00e9mon.\nMagikarp is the only Pok\u00e9mon which can be found in every Pok\u00e9mon Snap course except Rainbow Cloud, which features only Mew.\nTogether with Pichu, Rattata, Ninjask, Goldeen, and Seedot, Magikarp is the easiest Pok\u00e9mon to catch in Pok\u00e9mon Ranger, with only one loop necessary.\nMagikarp is the only Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Conquest that uses a move that it does not share a type with, as it uses Splash.\nOn July 28, 2016, and May 12, 2017, The Pok\u00e9mon Company and The Pok\u00e9mon Company International respectively posted a Magikarp-themed music video onto their YouTube channels, titled the Magikarp Song.\nMagikarp appears in Pok\u00e9mon Battle Chess. It doesn't behave like any traditional piece in chess. When damaged, it reveals Gyarados.\nAlthough Magikarp is stated by multiple Pok\u00e9dex entries to be \"the weakest Pok\u00e9mon\", there are several Pok\u00e9mon with lower base stat totals, such as Sunkern, or even access to fewer viable moves, like Unown only being able to learn Hidden Power, and Cosmog and Cosmoem being unable to learn any damaging moves at all.\nOrigin\n  Bulbanews has an article related to this subject: On the Origin of Species: Magikarp  \nMagikarp is based on the Asian carp, which are easily frightened by disturbances in water and can jump 8\u201310 feet (2.5\u20133 m.) in the air. Its Shiny coloration may be a visual pun on a goldfish. The golden dorsal fin of Magikarp may be based on a crown which likely originate from the pun on the Japanese word for goldfish \u91d1\u9b5a Kingyo. Magikarp's permanently open mouth may be a reference to koinobori, a carp-shaped windsock traditionally flown to celebrate Children's Day in Japan.\nMagikarp's evolution into Gyarados is based on a legend about how carp that leaped over the Dragon Gate would become dragons. Several waterfalls and cataracts in China are believed to be the location of the Dragon Gate. This legend is an allegory of the drive and efforts needed to overcome obstacles. This may have inspired an element in Pok\u00e9mon Snap where, after certain steps are taken, a Magikarp will splash its way into a waterfall where it evolves.\n\nName origin\nMagikarp may be a combination of magic (referring to its drastic power increase upon evolving into Gyarados or to magical goldfishes) and carp.\nKoiking may be a combination of \u9bc9 koi (carp) and king, which may come from \u91d1\u9b5a Kingyo (goldfish).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b3\u30a4\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 Koiking\n\nFrom \u9bc9 koi and king\n\n\n French\n\nMagicarpe\n\nFrom magique and carpe\n\n\n Spanish\n\nMagikarp\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nKarpador\n\nFrom Karpfen and Dorsch\n\n\n Italian\n\nMagikarp\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc789\uc5b4\ud0b9 Ingeoking\n\nFrom \uc789\uc5b4 ing-eo and king\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u9bc9\u9b5a\u738b / \u9ca4\u9c7c\u738b L\u01d0y\u00faw\u00e1ng\n\nFrom \u9bc9\u9b5a / \u9ca4\u9c7c l\u01d0y\u00fa and \u738b w\u00e1ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u9bc9\u9b5a\u738b L\u00e9ih'y\u00f9hw\u00f2hng\n\nFrom \u9bc9\u9b5a l\u00e9ih'y\u00f9h and \u738b w\u00f2hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Greek\n\n\u039c\u03ac\u03c4\u03b6\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03c0 M\u00e1tzikarp\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05de\u05d2'\u05d9\u05e7\u05d0\u05e8\u05e4 Mejikarp\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092e\u0948\u091c\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092a Magikarp\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Brazilian Portuguese\n\nMagicarpa\n\nFrom m\u00e1gica and carpa\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041c\u044d\u0434\u0436\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043f Medzhikarp\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e04\u0e34\u0e07 Khoikhing\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nMisty's Gyarados\nJames's Magikarp\nGoh's giant Magikarp\nMagikarp salesman\nMagikarp salesman's Magikarp\nSilver's Gyarados\nRed Gyarados\nLance's Magikarp\nGyarados (UNITE)\nExternal links\nArticle on Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0128: Tauros\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0130: Gyarados\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Magikarp_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4144772\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monWater-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Slow experience groupRed-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 03 Pok\u00e9monWater 2 group Pok\u00e9monDragon group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hoenn Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Sinnoh Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hisui Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kitakami Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 200Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 21 max performance starsPok\u00e9mon that cannot learn TMsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 13 October 2024, at 12:28.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
