While it typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. It has large, purplish, or reddish eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and feet has three pointed digits. The end of its long, squirrel-like tail curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between the two halves.\nSquirtle's shell is a useful tool. It can withdraw into the shell for protection or to sleep. The grooved, rounded shape helps to reduce water resistance, allowing the Pok\u00e9mon to swim at high speeds. Squirtle can spray foamy water from its mouth with great accuracy. Squirtle is scarce in the wild, although it can be found around small ponds and lakes. Squirtle can also be found residing around rivers in mountainous regions, as shown in Pok\u00e9mon Snap and Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise, Squirtle is shown to be found living on secluded islands with other members of their evolutionary line. Sharpedo is a natural predator of Squirtle. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Squirtle is known to sleep by withdrawing its limbs and head into its shell.[1] It does this to protect itself from threats while sleeping. It also occasionally rocks contentedly from side to side while sleeping.\nIn Generation II, Squirtle and its evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding.\n\n\nEvolution\nSquirtle evolves into Wartortle, which evolves into Blastoise.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nSquirtle\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\nLevel 16\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nWartortle\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\nLevel 36\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nBlastoise\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #007\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nAfter birth, its back swells and hardens into a shell.

By then, it had already evolved into a Blastoise.\nSquirtle was seen in a flashback during I Choose You!, which is set in a different continuity from Pok\u00e9mon the Series. Professor Oak revealed to Ash that it had already been collected.\n\nAsh's Squirtle\nSquirtle physically debuted in Here Comes the Squirtle Squad as the leader of the Squirtle Squad, a gang of rogue Squirtle who were deserted by their Trainers. Ash befriended and caught this Squirtle, who stayed with Ash until The Fire-ing Squad!, when it returned to the Squirtle Squad. However, it briefly reappeared in Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire, to assist Ash with his final battle against Brandon, and in Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series, where it briefly reunited with its Trainer.\n\nSquirtle Squad\nThe Squirtle Squad were a gang of rogue Squirtle who were deserted by their Trainers, who appeared in Here Comes the Squirtle Squad. While Ash befriended and caught their leader, the rest of them became a firefighting group after stopping a forest fire started by Team Rocket, under the guidance of Officer Jenny.\n\nMay's Squirtle\nMay received a Squirtle from Professor Oak in The Right Place and the Right Mime. This Squirtle was visibly younger and timid, but was used in several Contests. Squirtle would evolve into Wartortle by the time it appeared in Staging a Heroes Welcome.\n\nTeam Go-Getters\nThe main character in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Team Go-Getters Out of the Gate! special is a Squirtle that claims that he used to be human. He joined Team Go-Getters in their rescue work. He was initially unable to use Water Gun, but learned the move later during a battle against Skarmory.\n\nTierno's Squirtle\nTierno's Squirtle debuted in Summer of Discovery!. It evolved into Wartortle by the time of Good Friends, Great Training! and then into Blastoise by Tag Team Battle Inspiration!.\n\nOther\nIn Beach Blank-Out Blastoise, multiple Blastoise and Wartortle were troubled by their leader, a Blastoise, not waking up.\nIn Mewtwo Strikes Back, a Squirtle was cloned from Ash's Squirtle. It then participated in the battle between the original Pok\u00e9mon and the cloned Pok\u00e9mon. Squirtle reappeared in Mewtwo Returns.\nIn Journey to the Starting Line!, a Squirtle was one of the three Kanto first partner Pok\u00e9mon Gilbert was supposed to choose from. After they were scared off by Ash's Tauros, Professor Oak, Tracey, Delia, and Gilbert had to split up and find the three missing Pok\u00e9mon. Squirtle was the second one found, being found stuck in a tree that was hanging over a cliff.

When leveled up, it evolves into Wartortle.\"\n\nSuper Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U\nSquirtle does not return as a playable character in either version of the game.

Squirtle's always a popular choice, what with him being so flipping adorable. When it's in danger, though, it withdraws into its shell and spits a high-pressure burst of water, which isn't quite so adorable.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nSquirtle appears once again as a playable Pok\u00e9mon fighter used by the Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.\n\nPOK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu\nFive Squirtle appeared in POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu.\n\nCelestial\nSquirtle appeared in the music video for Celestial.\n\n\nTrivia\nThere was a scene in the 2004 film Godzilla: Final Wars where a boy throws an action figure of Squirtle into a fire and insults it. This is also a presumed reference to Gamera.[2]\nCultural impact\n $1 coins from Niue\nNiue released a one-dollar coin featuring Squirtle as part of a commemorative promotion for the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, with Squirtle on one side and the nation's coat of arms on the other.\nOrigin\nSquirtle's design is based on both its final evolved form and baby turtles,[3] though its anatomy and semi-aquatic lifestyle are much more similar to terrapins, with proportions matching those of the big-headed turtle. Much like Wartortle, its tail is a reference to Japanese legends of the minogame (\u84d1\u4e80), a turtle which lived for 10,000 years and grew a tail made of seaweed.\n\nName origin\nSquirtle is a combination of squirt (to spray) and turtle. The name was chosen in apparent reference to water guns, which were thought of as \"cool\" toys for children.[4] \"Squirt\" is also a slang term for a small child.\nZenigame may be a combination of \u92ad zeni (money) and \u4e80 kame (turtle), forming the word \u92ad\u4e80 zenigame (baby Japanese pond turtle). According to Pok\u00e9mon Black and White's television program Pok\u00e9Quiz, \"'Zeni' is an old-fashioned word for money. Squirtle's shells look like old coins, so that's how they got their name!\"\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\nThis section is incomplete.Please feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it.
