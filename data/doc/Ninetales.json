It has a small mane of thicker fur around its neck and a long, fluffy crest atop its head. It has slender legs with three-toed paws and nine long tails with pale orange tips. It has red eyes, pointed ears, and a triangular black nose.\nA legend claims that Ninetales is the reincarnation of 9 united noble saints. While intelligent enough to easily understand human speech, Ninetales is a vengeful Pok\u00e9mon known to curse those who mistreat it. Ninetales will also curse anyone who wakes it up by grabbing one of its many tails. The curse can last up to 1,000 years. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team, once a Ninetales casts its curse, it cannot be removed even by Ninetales itself. It can live for 1,000 years due to the energy within its nine tails, each of which is said to have a different mystical power. Flames spewed from its mouth can hypnotize an opponent and its gleaming red eyes are said to give it the ability to control minds. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Ninetales is known to sleep while wrapped inside its tails, giving it a mystical appearance.[1] In the first Pok\u00e9mon movie, it's shown that it can swim. Pok\u00e9mon-Amie shows that Ninetales lick their paws to clean themselves. Being the result of an Evolution via Evolution stone, Ninetales are rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in grasslands.\n\nForms\nNinetales has a regional form: Alolan Ninetales.\nIn the Alola region, Ninetales have a different appearance. Its coat is pale blue, and its fur is more flowing and wispier. The tips of its tails and crest and the lower halves of its legs are white. The crest on its head is longer, and its nine tails are less distinct. Additionally, it has larger blue eyes and small tufts of fur in front of its ears.\nAlolan Ninetales lives on Alola's snow-capped Mount Lanakila, which some consider holy ground. As such, it is revered as a sacred messenger or deity. Alolan Ninetales has a gentle and calm temperament and is known to aid lost humans in distress, though this is primarily done to keep them out of its territory. It will punish any threat to its pack of Vulpix. Those who anger it will be frozen stiff in an instant. It can produce ice crystals from its fur, which it can use for both offense and defense. The ice crystals can act as a shield or form balls that can be fired like bullets with enough force to shatter rock.[2] They can also be found in the Polar Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated.\n\nEvolution\nNinetales evolves from Vulpix.\nAlolan Ninetales evolves from Alolan Vulpix.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nNinetales\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nVulpix\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nNinetales\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlolan Ninetales\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nVulpixAlolan Form\u00a0Ice\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nNinetalesAlolan Form\u00a0Ice\u00a0\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Ninetales cast a curse on a human that would turn it into a Pok\u00e9mon, bringing on many natural disasters. The player is blamed for this and travels to the home of Ninetales at the top of Mt. Freeze to learn the truth. Ninetales appears again when Gengar wishes to make right what he did to Gardevoir. He gives Gengar the 9-Tail Crest and sends him and the player to Murky Cave.\nPok\u00e9mon Super Mystery Dungeon: Ninetales returns, asking the player to visit its hideout.

It is a ranged attacker that starts as Alolan Vulpix, which evolves into Alolan Ninetales at level 4.\n\n\nTrivia\nIn English, the category \"Fox Pok\u00e9mon\" is shared by Vulpix, Fennekin, Nickit, and their evolutions.\nIn Japanese, the hiragana category \"\u304d\u3064\u306d\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\" (Fox Pok\u00e9mon) is shared by the evolutionary lines of Vulpix and Nickit, while the katakana version \"\u30ad\u30c4\u30cd\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\" (Fox Pok\u00e9mon) is shared by Fennekin and its evolutions.\nNo other Pok\u00e9mon has the same type combination as Alolan Ninetales.\nAlolan Ninetales is the only Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus which requires Evolution to obtain it.\nVulpix and Ninetales are the only Pok\u00e9mon whose Alolan forms are obtainable in Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus.\nNinetales's name is misspelled as Ninetails in the Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game for the Game Boy Color and in some prerelease material.\nNinetales's National Pok\u00e9dex number and Kitakami Pok\u00e9dex number are identical: 0038 for the former, and 38 for the latter.\nAlolan Ninetales was featured in the sixth episode of Beyond the Pok\u00e9dex series.\nOrigin\nNinetales may be based on a red fox and the \u72d0 kitsune of Japanese legend, which are said to have many tails, extremely long lifespans, and supernatural powers such as the ability to breathe fire. After reaching an advanced age, kitsune take on spirit forms, which may explain why Ninetales can learn various Ghost-type and Psychic-type moves. Specifically, it may be based on the ky\u016bbi no kitsune, whose fur turns white-gold after it has lived for 1,000 years and gains its ninth tail.\nAlolan Ninetales may be based on an Arctic fox, which grows a white coat of fur in the winter to camouflage in the snow. Its mountain habitat and lore as a deity incarnation may be a reference to Poli\u02bbahu, the Hawaiian goddess of snow who is said to reside on Mauna Kea. It could also be inspired by tulikettu, a mythical fox creature of Finnish lore whose radiant fur is said to be responsible for the creation of the northern lights. The Finnish word for aurora, revontulet, also literally translates to \"fox fires\" which could be intentional as Ninetales' original form is a Fire-type.\n\nName origin\nNinetales may be a combination of nine and tales, referring to fairy tales (alluding to it being based on a mythical creature) as well as being a homophone to tails. It may also reference the cat o' nine tails whip (due to its tendency to punish anyone who grabs its tails).\nKyukon may be a combination of \u4e5d ky\u016b (nine) or \u4e5d\u5c3e\u72d0 ky\u016bbiko (nine-tailed fox) and \u3053\u3093 kon (onomatopoetic sound of a fox's cry). It may also involve \u65e7\u6068 ky\u016bkon (old grudge) and \u711c\u7089 konro (gas stove).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30ad\u30e5\u30a6\u30b3\u30f3 Kyukon\n\nFrom \u4e5d ky\u016b, \u4e5d\u5c3e\u72d0 ky\u016bbiko, \u3053\u3093 kon, and possibly \u711c\u7089 konro and \u65e7\u6068 ky\u016bkon\n\n\n French\n\nFeunard\n\nFrom feu, renard, and neuf\n\n\n Spanish\n\nNinetales\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nVulnona\n\nFrom the genus Vulpes and nona\n\n\n Italian\n\nNinetales\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub098\uc778\ud14c\uc77c Ninetail\n\nFrom nine and tail\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u4e5d\u5c3e Ji\u01d4w\u011bi\n\nFrom \u4e5d ji\u01d4 and \u5c3e w\u011bi, as well as a reference to \u4e5d\u5c3e\u72d0 ji\u01d4w\u011bih\u00fa\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u4e5d\u5c3e G\u00e1um\u00e9ih\n\nFrom \u4e5d g\u00e1u and \u5c3e m\u00e9ih, as well as a reference to \u4e5d\u5c3e\u72d0 g\u00e1um\u00e9ihw\u00f9h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0928\u093e\u0907\u0928\u091f\u0947\u0932\u094d\u0938 Ninetails\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nDevinuodeg\u0117\n\nTranslation of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041d\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0442\u044d\u0439\u043b\u0441 Naynteyls\u0414\u0435\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0445\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442 Devyatikhvost\n\nTranscription of English nameLiterally \"nine-tailed\"\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e04\u0e34\u0e27\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e19 Khiokhon\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nEnta's Ninetales\nAlolan Ninetales (UNITE)\nRegional form\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex entry: \"Its nine gorgeous tails are said to be imbued with supernatural power.
