It has brown eyes, a dark blue streak on each cheek, and two sharp teeth protruding from its upper jaw. It has three clawed fingers and pointed toes. On each side of its head are feather-like ears covered in pale blue fur. A brown shell with a pale yellow underside encases its body. A thick, white rim separates the upper and lower halves of the shell. An older Wartortle may have scars and algae growing on its shell. Poking out of the bottom of the shell is a thick, wavy tail that also has light blue fur and cannot be fully withdrawn into its shell. Its tail fur will darken with age. Its tail symbolizes longevity and good luck, making this Pok\u00e9mon popular with the elderly.\nBecause it is larger than Squirtle and has a larger shell, Wartortle has a more difficult time walking on land and keeping its balance in the water. Wartortle moves its furry ears and tail as both rudders and balancing rods to maintain balance while swimming at high speeds. Air can be stored in its fur for extended underwater diving. It hides in water when hunting and emerges to surprise its prey. It's shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise that Wartortle can be found living in colonies on islands. Still, its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, is known to sleep with its body tucked into its shell while remaining wary of threats.[1] It leaves its long, furry tail poking out a bit to feel out its surroundings in case of danger.\nIn Generation II, Wartortle and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding.\n\nEvolution\nWartortle evolves from Squirtle and evolves into Blastoise.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nSquirtle\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\nLevel 16\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nWartortle\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\nLevel 36\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nBlastoise\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #008\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nOften hides in water to stalk unwary prey.

Its feathery tail is a reference to Japanese legends of the minogame (\u84d1\u4e80), a turtle which lived for 10,000 years and grew a tail made of seaweed. The use of its tail to store oxygen seems to be a reference to certain turtles that breathe through their cloaca, placed near the tail. The tail also resembles wind waves.\n\nName origin\nWartortle may be a combination of war or warrior, water, tortoise, and turtle.\nKameil may be a combination of \u4e80 kame (turtle, tortoise) and tail.\n\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30ab\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb Kameil\n\nFrom \u4e80 kame and tail\n\n\n French\n\nCarabaffe\n\nFrom carapace and baffe\n\n\n Spanish\n\nWartortle\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nSchillok\n\nFrom Schildkr\u00f6te and Locke\n\n\n Italian\n\nWartortle\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc5b4\ub2c8\ubd80\uae30 Eonibugi\n\nFrom \uc5b4\uae08\ub2c8 eogeumni or \uc5b8\ub2c8 eonni and \uac70\ubd81\uc774 geobugi\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5361\u54aa\u9f9c / \u5361\u54aa\u9f9f K\u01cem\u012bgu\u012b\n\nFrom the partial transcription of its Japanese name and \u9f9c / \u9f9f gu\u012b\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5361\u54aa\u9f9c K\u0101m\u0101igw\u0101i*\u5361\u7f8e\u9f9c K\u0101m\u00e9ihgw\u0101i *\n\nFrom the partial transcription of its Japanese name and \u9f9c gw\u0101iFrom the partial transcription of its Japanese name and \u9f9c gw\u0101i\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Bulgarian\n\n\u0423\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0442\u044a\u043b Uortort\u016dl \n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d5\u05d5\u05e8\u05d8\u05d5\u05e8\u05d8\u05dc Wartortle\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0935\u0949\u0930\u091f\u0949\u0930\u094d\u091f\u0932 Wartortle\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nKarv\u0117\u017elys\n\nTranslation of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0412\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043b Vartortl\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e04\u0e32\u0e40\u0e21\u0e25 Khamen\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nGary's Wartortle\nTeam Wartortle\nMay's Wartortle\nTierno's Wartortle\nBlasty\nBlastoise (UNITE)\nFirst partner Pok\u00e9mon\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\nExternal links\nSection on Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0007: Squirtle\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0009: Blastoise\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Wartortle_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4126725\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monWater-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of seven males to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Slow experience groupBlue-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 06 Pok\u00e9monMonster group Pok\u00e9monWater 1 group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 405Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with 19 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 25 September 2024, at 22:33.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
