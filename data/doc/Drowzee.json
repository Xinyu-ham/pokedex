It has tired-looking eyes, a short trunk above its mouth, and triangular ears with brown interiors. The upper half of Drowzee's body is yellow and the lower half is brown. A wavy line separates the two halves. It has a round belly and short legs. Its feet are brown, except for its two toes, which are yellow. The bottom of each foot has a small, round, pink pad in the middle of it. There are three fingers on each of its hands. Drowzee is believed to have a common ancestor with Munna and Musharna.\nDrowzee is able to put people to sleep and can then sense the person's dreams. This is so it knows what kind of dream it would be eating. It has certain preferences for the dreams it eats, and it is known to love fun dreams and become ill from bad dreams. It will rarely eat the dreams of adults, as the dreams of children are seemingly tastier. Drowzee remembers every dream it has eaten and may show past meals to a person it trusts. It eats dreams through the victim's nose, so it is said that Drowzee is standing over a person's pillow if their nose itches while they are asleep. Drowzee lives in grasslands and savannas.\n\nEvolution\nDrowzee evolves into Hypno.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nDrowzee\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nHypno\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Ranger: After the credits, a man calling himself the Drowsy Guy stands on the Fiore Temple with two Drowzee.

The player's team saves Azurill and gets Drowzee arrested. Later, when Azurill cannot wake up from a nightmare, the player's team looks for Drowzee's help. He sends the player's team into Azurill's dream to find out the problem.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #096\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nPuts enemies to sleep then eats their dreams.

Originally, they were composite animals, but later became tapirs \u2014 pig-like animals with small trunks from South America and South Asia. Drowzee's dual coloring makes it especially similar to the Malayan tapir.\n\nName origin\nDrowzee may be a combination of drowsy and zzz (onomatopoeia for snoring).\nSleepe may be derived from sleep.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b9\u30ea\u30fc\u30d7 Sleepe\n\nFrom sleep\n\n\n French\n\nSoporifik\n\nFrom soporifique\n\n\n Spanish\n\nDrowzee\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nTraumato\n\nFrom Traum and traumatisch\n\n\n Italian\n\nDrowzee\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc2ac\ub9ac\ud504 Sllip\n\nFrom sleep\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u50ac\u7720\u8c98 Cu\u012bmi\u00e1nm\u00f2*\u7d20\u5229\u666e S\u00f9l\u00ecp\u01d4*\n\nFrom \u50ac\u7720 cu\u012bmi\u00e1n and \u8c98 m\u00f2Transcription of Japanese name\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u50ac\u7720\u8c98 Ch\u0113uim\u00echnmohk*\u98df\u5922\u7378 Sihkmuhngsau\n\nFrom \u50ac\u7720 ch\u0113uim\u00echn and \u8c98 mohkFrom \u98df\u5922 sihkmuhng and \u7378 sau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0921\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0909\u091c\u093c\u0940 Drowzee\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0414\u0440\u0430\u0443\u0437\u0438 Drauzi\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e2a\u0e25\u0e35\u0e1b Slip\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nDrowzee (Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky)\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0095: Onix\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0097: Hypno\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Drowzee_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128561\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monPsychic-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupYellow-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 12 Pok\u00e9monHuman-Like group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 328Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 17 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 16:23.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
