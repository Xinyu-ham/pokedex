It has a clear, light blue body that has two large, red orbs on either side and smaller orb in the center. Its eyes are visible in its round lower body, which is black. Extending from its lower body are two blue, beak-like appendages and numerous grayish tentacles. Its red orbs glow whenever it is excited or agitated, communicating with its own kind, and it may alert others to danger by stridently flashing them. They are also capable of refracting sunlight, storing energy, and firing ultrasonic waves.\nTentacruel's primarily light blue body helps it camouflage in the water. It has a total of 80 tentacles, which it can readily extend during hunts to ensnare its prey in a net-like shape before immobilizing it with poison. The tentacles can grow or shrink with ease. Its tentacles can absorb water to stretch even further. Most of these tentacles are hidden and kept short, leaving up to 14 exposed. However, it tends to lose tentacles as it ages. While Tentacruel are rarely seen, they can gather in large groups which scares away any nearby fish Pok\u00e9mon. Tentacruel lives in underwater rock formations and can be found throughout the ocean.\nAlthough Toedscruel bears a strong resemblance to Tentacruel, the two species are biologically unrelated.\n\nEvolution\nTentacruel evolves from Tentacool.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nTentacool\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nTentacruel\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team: Tentacruel is a member of Team Constrictor.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #073\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nThe tentacles are normally kept short.

It also shares some characteristics of a squid. Additionally, Tentacruel resembles several varieties of the bug-eyed monster and other alien invaders from 1950s B-movies, which is reflected in its ability to fire lasers from the gems on its head.\n\nName origin\nTentacruel may be a combination of tentacle and cruel.\nDokukurage may be a combination of \u6bd2 doku (poison) and \u6c34\u6bcd kurage (jellyfish).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30c9\u30af\u30af\u30e9\u30b2 Dokukurage\n\nFrom \u6bd2 doku or \u76ee\u306e\u6bd2 me no doku and \u6c34\u6bcd kurage\n\n\n French\n\nTentacruel\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Spanish\n\nTentacruel\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nTentoxa\n\nFrom Tentakel and toxisch\n\n\n Italian\n\nTentacruel\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub3c5\ud30c\ub9ac Tokpari\n\nFrom \ub3c5 (\u6bd2) dok and \ud574\ud30c\ub9ac haepari\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u6bd2\u523a\u6c34\u6bcd D\u00fac\u00ecshu\u01d0m\u01d4\n\nFrom \u6bd2\u523a d\u00fac\u00ec and \u6c34\u6bcd shu\u01d0m\u01d4\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u6bd2\u523a\u6c34\u6bcd Duhkchis\u00e9uim\u00f3uh*\u591a\u8173\u6c34\u6bcd D\u014dgeuks\u00e9uim\u00f3uh*\n\nFrom \u6bd2\u523a duhkchi and \u6c34\u6bcd s\u00e9uim\u00f3uhFrom \u591a\u8173 d\u014d geuk and \u6c34\u6bcd s\u00e9uim\u00f3uh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Arabic\n\n\u062a\u064a\u0646\u062a\u0627\u0643\u0631\u0648\u0644 Tintakrul\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d8\u05e0\u05d8\u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05dc Tentacrool\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u091f\u0947\u0902\u091f\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0930\u0942\u0905\u0932 Tentacruel\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0422\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0443\u043b Tentakrul\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e42\u0e14\u0e04\u0e38\u0e04\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e40\u0e01\u0e30 Dokhukhurake\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Vietnamese\n\nDokukurage\n\nFrom the Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nToedscruel\nEcologically similar Pok\u00e9mon\nExternal links\n\nEcologically similar Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also:Regional forms (Alolan \u2022 Galarian \u2022 Hisuian \u2022 Paldean)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0072: Tentacool\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0074: Geodude\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Tentacruel_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128047\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monWater-type Pok\u00e9monPoison-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Slow experience groupBlue-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 10 Pok\u00e9monWater 3 group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hoenn Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Sinnoh Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hisui Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 515Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special DefensePok\u00e9mon whose base Special Defense stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon whose base Special stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon with 16 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 13:15.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
