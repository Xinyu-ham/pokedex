It has a round body, beady red eyes, a small mouth, and ovoid feet. Five large, green leaves sprout from its head. As demonstrated in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Foul Weather Friends, these leaves are prehensile and can be used to scale vertical surfaces and catch light objects. Known by the scientific name Oddium Wanderus, Oddish lives in grasslands.\nA nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon, Oddish buries its sensitive body in the ground during the day to avoid the sun and fool predators. If its leaves are pulled in this state, it will respond by shrieking horribly. It starts to move when its leaves begin absorbing moonlight, which it uses to grow. Oddish will wander up to 1,000 feet (300 meters) during the night to scatter its seeds and find a nutrient-rich patch of soil in which to plant itself. The more fertile the earth, the glossier its leaves will be. It is thought that its feet become like tree roots while planted. In Generation I, Petal Dance was its signature move.\n\nEvolution\nOddish evolves into Gloom, which evolves into either Vileplume or Bellossom.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nOddish\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nGloom\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2197\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nVileplume\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2198\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nBellossom\u00a0Grass\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #043\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nDuring the day, it keeps its face buried in the ground.

However, in those games and subsequent generations, Oddish's body (unless it is Shiny) is blue. The mistake might have been a translation error caused by the ambiguity of the Japanese word \u9752\u3044 aoi, which can mean both blue and green. This is fixed in Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver.\nOddish has a scientific name: Oddium Wanderus, given in its FireRed and Y Pok\u00e9dex entries. The only other Pok\u00e9mon with a known scientific name is Kabutops, with Kabutops Maximus.\nIn the Japanese versions of FireRed and Y, as well as Red and Green, Oddish's Pok\u00e9dex entries instead state that it has the alias name \u30a2\u30eb\u30ad\u30e1\u30f3\u30c7\u30b9 Arukimendesu. This can either be seen as a corruption of Archimedes, the Greek mathematician; or as a direct reference to a popular Japanese instant noodles brand Archimendes, which literally means \u6b69\u304d\u9eba\u3067\u3059 aruki men desu (instant noodles on the go). The latter may reference Oddish's appearance when walking.\nOddish can be seen as a parallel to Bellsprout. Both are Grass/Poison-type Generation I Pok\u00e9mon, part of a three-stage evolutionary line, can evolve starting at level 21, and whose second evolutionary event utilizes a Leaf Stone. Oddish is exclusive to Pok\u00e9mon Red, FireRed, and Let's Go, Pikachu! while Bellsprout is exclusive to Blue, LeafGreen, and Let's Go, Eevee!, with both Pok\u00e9mon found in the same locations in their respective versions. Additionally, both can be found at White Forest in White, and both Pok\u00e9mon have had their Egg designs revealed.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver, Oddish is programmed to be able to learn Charm through breeding, but no other Pok\u00e9mon in the Grass Group can legitimately learn it to pass down as an Egg Move in those games. In Generation III and IV, Oddish can inherit the move from Shroomish by chain breeding. In Generation V onwards, Oddish can inherit the move directly from Cottonee.\nThere is a recurring gag in Pok\u00e9mon the Series where when Ash hears rustling in a bush, he looks in it and finds an Oddish.\nOddish was featured in the third episode of Beyond the Pok\u00e9dex.\nOrigin\n  Bulbanews has an article related to this subject: On the Origin of Species: Oddish  \nOddish seems to be based on mandrake, plants from the Mandragora genus whose roots sometimes resemble human figures. Its habit of screaming when yanked out of the ground may be a reference to the myth that mandrakes will emit a deadly cry when uprooted. Its round body is also similar to various bulbous plant such as onions as well as root vegetables such as radishes and turnips. Its leaves are similar in shape to those of the snake plant.\n\nName origin\nOddish may be derived from oddish (somewhat odd) or a combination of odd (strange) and radish.\nNazonokusa may be a play on \u8b0e\u306e\u8349 nazo no kusa (enigmatic herb).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30ca\u30be\u30ce\u30af\u30b5 Nazonokusa\n\nFrom \u8b0e\u306e\u8349 nazo no kusa\n\n\n French\n\nMystherbe\n\nFrom myst\u00e8re and herbe\n\n\n Spanish\n\nOddish\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nMyrapla\n\nFrom myrtle or mysteri\u00f6s and plant\n\n\n Italian\n\nOddish\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub69c\ubc85\ucd78 Ttubeogcho\n\nFrom \ub69c\ubc85\ub69c\ubc85 ttubeok-ttubeok and \ucd08 (\u8349) cho\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u8d70\u8def\u8349 Z\u01d2ul\u00f9c\u01ceo\n\nFrom \u8d70\u8def z\u01d2ul\u00f9 and \u8349 c\u01ceo\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u8d70\u8def\u8349 J\u00e1ulouhch\u00f3u*\u884c\u8def\u8349 Ha\u00e0hnglouhch\u00f3u*\n\nFrom \u884c\u8def j\u00e1ulouh and \u8349 ch\u00f3uFrom \u884c\u8def ha\u00e0hnglouh and \u8349 ch\u00f3u\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d0\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e9 Odish\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0911\u0921\u093f\u0936 Oddish\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nOdi\u0161as\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041e\u0434\u0434\u0438\u0448 Oddish\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e19\u0e32\u0e42\u0e0b\u0e42\u0e19\u0e30\u0e04\u0e38\u0e2a\u0e30 Nasonokhusa\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0042: Golbat\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0044: Gloom\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Oddish_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128548\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monGrass-type Pok\u00e9monPoison-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Slow experience groupBlue-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 07 Pok\u00e9monGrass group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon with branched EvolutionsPok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hoenn Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 320Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with 18 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 16:23.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
