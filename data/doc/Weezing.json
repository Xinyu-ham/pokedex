The heads have different sizes and features. The left head is larger and has prominent eyebrows, pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw, and two flat teeth in its upper jaw. The smaller, right head simply has two pointed teeth, one at each corner of its mouth. The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short time span because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare.\nEach of Weezing's heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, Weezing's gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level.\nWeezing lives in urban areas. It seeks a dirty, unkempt house and nests there. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash. Weezing feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste. Weezing's body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases. The Kantonian Weezing used to be common in Galar and created more potent toxins than their Galarian relatives.\nWeezing and its pre-evolved form are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Neutralizing Gas as an Ability.\n\nForms\n Galarian Weezing absorbing pollutants from a factory and expelling clean air\nWeezing has a regional form: Galarian Weezing.\nIn the Galar region, its appearance has changed due to absorbing polluted air from factories. It has a gray body with the skull, crossbones, and ring patterns changed to the color yellow. Both heads have a hat-like tube located on top of them that constantly releases purified air. Five puffs of green poison gas clouds can be seen floating around it. The gas clouds also partly cover its faces: the larger head has a mustache-like cloud on its upper lip, while the smaller head has clouds on its face in the shape of eyebrows and a beard.\nGalarian Weezing consumes particles from polluted air and expels clean air instead of droppings. The toxins within Galarian Weezing's body are accumulated into poison gas clouds that leak and drift around it. The gas is its best weapon in battle, being potent enough to stun and immobilize an opponent with just a whiff.[1] Galarian Weezing preys on Trubbish for the fumes it produces.\nGalarian Weezing is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Strange Steam. Additionally, in Generation IX, Galarian Weezing is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Misty Surge as an Ability.\n\n\nEvolution\nWeezing evolves from Koffing.\nIn Galar, Weezing has a regional form that evolves from Koffing.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nKoffing\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nWeezing\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nWeezingGalarian Form\u00a0Poison\u00a0\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #110\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nWhere two kinds of poison gases meet, 2 Koffings can fuse into a Weezing over many years.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nIt lives and grows by absorbing dust, germs and poison gases that are contained in toxic waste and garbage.\n\n\nStadium \n\nA twinned Koffing that forms on rare occasions where poisonous gases pool.

It defeated the instructor's Flareon with its Smog, Smokescreen, and Tackle attacks. Later on, Ash commanded it to use Explosion against Team Rocket, causing them to blast off.\nIn Healing the Healer!, a group of Pok\u00e9mon hunters used a Weezing to poison a lake in an attempt to draw the attention of Suicune. Once Goh caught Suicune, it was used to battle Ash and Goh before eventually being defeated.\nIn Orla and the Pok\u00e9 Ball Smith, Roy was attacked by a group of Galarian Weezing after he accidentally hit one with an experimental Pok\u00e9 Ball.

Melee\nWhen released from a Pok\u00e9 Ball, Weezing will hover in place and emit Poison Gas that juggles any opponent who comes near it, essentially serving the function of its pre-evolution, Koffing, from Super Smash Bros.\nWeezing is also a float in the Pok\u00e9 Float stage. It appears as Chikorita leaves. Once Slowpoke appears, it will slowly deflate and move to the top of the screen.\n\nTrophy information\nThe evolved form of Koffing, Weezing is basically a pair of Koffing fused together. They tend to float in the air and emit gas or noxious smoke from the outgrowths that cover their bodies. As strange as it may seem, diluting Weezing emissions as much as possible creates one of the most exquisite perfumes known to man.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nWeezing appears as a Spirit.\n\nTrivia\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue beta, Weezing was originally known as \"La\", representing Los Angeles' polluted air.\nWeezing is the only Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon that consists of multiple bodies.\nGalarian Weezing is the only Fairy-type Pok\u00e9mon that consists of multiple bodies.\nIn certain instances in the games, such as summary pages and Pok\u00e9mon Contests, a Pok\u00e9mon's sprite is horizontally flipped, unless its body is asymmetrical. However, Weezing's sprite is flipped in all instances despite its asymmetrical body.\nThe Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum Pok\u00e9dex entries for Weezing claim triplet forms have been discovered, but this variant has not been shown in any Pok\u00e9mon media.\nWeezing shares similar traits to Muk and Garbodor. All three Pok\u00e9mon are pure Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon with a single pre-evolved form, roughly the same base stat totals and evolution levels, and appear to be based on a different kind of pollution; Weezing being air pollution.\nGalarian Weezing is tied with Xerneas as the tallest Fairy-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nAlthough Weezing and Galarian Weezing do not appear in Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus, the smoke tower on the rooftop of the Galaxy Hall resembles a Galarian Weezing.\nKantonian Weezing and its pre-evolved form are the only Pok\u00e9mon whose Abilities changed in Generation VIII. In previous generations, their only Ability was Levitate.\nGalarian Weezing can learn more moves that cause it to faint than any other Pok\u00e9mon (Self-Destruct, Explosion, Memento, and Misty Explosion).\nGalarian Weezing was the first Galarian form to be officially revealed.\nGalarian Weezing has the shortest duration of time out of all Pok\u00e9mon between being made available in a mainline game and being made available in Pok\u00e9mon GO. It was made available in Pok\u00e9mon GO in Raid Battles on November 16, 2019, just one day after the release of Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield.\nOrigin\nConsidering its looks, its ability to float, and its tendency to explode, Weezing may have been based upon a floating naval mine or living meteorite. It is also based on smog and other forms of air pollution. It may also be based on the imagined fear that heavy pollution, caused by the leakage and/or improper disposal of toxic and/or radioactive waste, may result in the creation of new and undesirable life forms. Much like Koffing, the symbol under Weezing's larger face resembles the skull and crossbones, a hazard symbol for poison. The three orbs connected by stems that constitute its body resemble a molecule. Weezing's fused heads may also be based on conjoined twins and the effects of pollution-induced birth defects.\nGalarian Weezing takes inspiration from steam engines.[2] Its appearance in particular seems to be based on a stereotypical Victorian era British gentleman wearing a chimney hat, combined with actual chimneys. Both its smog-based \"facial hair\" and its Shield Pok\u00e9dex entry, which describes Weezing taking the form as a result of heavy air pollution, likely draw reference from the heavy smog that afflicted London during the Victorian era. Its ability to clean the air of pollutants may be based on air scrubbers, referring to the fact that they expel clean air as referenced in its Sword Pok\u00e9dex entry. The way Galarian Weezing feeds, absorbing polluted air and then releasing it through the chimney-like tubes on top of their heads as purified air, may have been based on the feeding method of sponges, which are animals that feed through filtration. Water enters the sponge's body bringing food particles (such as microorganisms) and, after being filtered by the animal, is eliminated through the osculum, a hole in the free end of the animal. Its design may also draw inspiration from nuclear cooling towers, referring to the clouds that they make being steam and not smoke as evidenced by its signature move Strange Steam. Additionally, its Fairy type and appearance may be a reference to leprechauns. Galarian Weezing's Shiny form may be based on sepia tone photography.\nGalarian Weezing's resemblance to Victorian era British noblemen, along with its Ability Neutralizing Gas, may be a play on noble gases, which are gaseous elements known for being highly unreactive and are typically used to prevent unwanted reactions from occuring.\n\nName origin\nWeezing may be a corruption of wheezing (producing a whistling sound while breathing with difficulty).\nMatadogas may come from \u53c8 mata (again) and \u6bd2\u30ac\u30b9 doku-gasu (poison gas). It may also be derived from \u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c9\u30ac\u30b9 masut\u0101dogasu (mustard gas).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30de\u30bf\u30c9\u30ac\u30b9 Matadogas\n\nFrom \u53c8 mata and \u6bd2\u30ac\u30b9 doku-gasu or mustard gas\n\n\n French\n\nSmogogo\n\nFrom smog or Smogo, \u00e0 gogo, and gogo\n\n\n Spanish\n\nWeezing\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nSmogmog\n\nFrom Smog\n\n\n Italian\n\nWeezing\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub610\ub3c4\uac00\uc2a4 Ttodogas\n\nFrom \ub610 tto and \ub3c5\uac00\uc2a4 dok-gaseu\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u96d9\u5f48\u74e6\u65af / \u53cc\u5f39\u74e6\u65af Shu\u0101ngd\u00e0nw\u01ces\u012b\n\nFrom \u96d9 / \u53cc shu\u0101ng, \u5f48 / \u5f39 d\u00e0n, and \u74e6\u65af w\u01ces\u012b\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u96d9\u5f48\u74e6\u65af S\u0113ungd\u00e1anng\u00e1hs\u012b*\u6bd2\u6c23\u96d9\u5b50 Duhkheis\u0113ungj\u00ed*\n\nFrom \u96d9 s\u0113ung, \u5f48 d\u00e1an, and \u74e6\u65af ng\u00e1hs\u012bFrom \u6bd2\u6c23 duhkhei and \u96d9\u5b50 s\u0113ungj\u00ed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0935\u0940\u091c\u093c\u093f\u0902\u0917 Weezing\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0412\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0433 Vizing\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e21\u0e32\u0e15\u0e32\u0e42\u0e14\u0e01\u0e31\u0e0b Matadokat\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nJames's Weezing\nRegional form\nPok\u00e9mon fusion\nWeaponry in the Pok\u00e9mon world\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Galarian Weezing | Official Website | Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield\n\n\u2191 (November 15, 2019). \"\u300c\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30bd\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u30b7\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u300d\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u3002\u300c\u6700\u5f37\u300d\u3092\u30c6\u30fc\u30de\u306b\uff0c\u5b50\u4f9b\u305f\u3061\u304c\u697d\u3057\u3081\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3057\u3066.\" 4Gamer.net.\n\n\nExternal links\n\n Galarian forms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: Regional forms (Alolan \u2022 Galarian \u2022 Hisuian \u2022 Paldean) \u2022 Ecologically similar Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Smash Bros. series\n\n\nGames:\n\nSuper Smash Bros. \u2022 Super Smash Bros.
