Ordinary Pikachu can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Pikachu if it has the Gigantamax Factor. Additionally, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media.\nCosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, the partner Pikachu, and Pikachu with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve. The Pikachu received at the beginning of Pok\u00e9mon Yellow will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is traded and evolved on another save file.\nPikachu is popularly known as the mascot of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise and one of Nintendo's major mascots. It is also the game mascot of and the player's first Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Yellow and Let's Go, Pikachu!, the player's first Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Rumble Blast and Pok\u00e9mon Rumble World, and has made numerous appearances on the covers of spin-off games.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biology\n\n1.1 Forms\n\n1.1.1 Cosplay Pikachu\n1.1.2 Pikachu in a cap\n1.1.3 Partner Pikachu\n1.1.4 Gigantamax Pikachu\n\n\n1.2 Evolution\n\n\n2 Game data\n\n2.1 As the player\n2.2 NPC appearances\n2.3 Pok\u00e9dex entries\n2.4 Game locations\n\n2.4.1 In side games\n2.4.2 In events\n\n2.4.2.1 Pikachu\n2.4.2.2 Original Cap Pikachu\n2.4.2.3 Hoenn Cap Pikachu\n2.4.2.4 Sinnoh Cap Pikachu\n2.4.2.5 Unova Cap Pikachu\n2.4.2.6 Kalos Cap Pikachu\n2.4.2.7 Alola Cap Pikachu\n2.4.2.8 Partner Cap Pikachu\n2.4.2.9 World Cap Pikachu\n\n\n2.4.3 In-game events\n\n2.4.3.1 Pikachu\n2.4.3.2 Partner Cap Pikachu\n\n\n2.4.4 Wild Area News\n\n2.4.4.1 Pikachu\n\n\n2.4.5 Pok\u00e9 Portal News\n2.4.6 Pok\u00e9mon Global Link promotions\n\n\n2.5 Held items\n2.6 Stats\n\n2.6.1 Base stats\n\n2.6.1.1 Generation I-V\n2.6.1.2 Generation VI onward\n2.6.1.3 Partner Pikachu\n\n\n2.6.2 Pok\u00e9athlon stats\n\n\n2.7 Type effectiveness\n2.8 Learnset\n\n2.8.1 By leveling up\n2.8.2 By TM\n2.8.3 By breeding\n2.8.4 By a prior Evolution\n2.8.5 By events\n2.8.6 TCG-only moves\n2.8.7 Animated series-only moves\n\n\n2.9 Side game data\n\n2.9.1 Pikachu\n2.9.2 Pikachu Libre\n2.9.3 Pikachu Pop Star\n2.9.4 Pikachu Rock Star\n2.9.5 Flying Pikachu\n2.9.6 Shaymin scarf Pikachu\n2.9.7 Pikachu Ph.

It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs; therefore, Pikachu is a facultative biped.\n\n In the mouth of Cramorant\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Pikachu's Goodbye, wild Pikachu are shown to live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In A Plethora of Pikachu!, it is shown that Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as with other Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forage for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. In The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga, it is depicted eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment. By occasion, it can get unintentionally swallowed by Cramorant. While startled, it looks for ways to escape from the latter.\nPikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It can release electric discharges of varying intensity. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Sparks Fly for Magnemite, Pikachu is shown to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharge fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu and its evolutionary relatives are related to Pachirisu. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Pikachu is known to generate electricity through its cheeks while sleeping. Pikachu discharges while sleeping due to it dreaming of firing electric shots.[1]\nPikachu and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Volt Tackle. Pikachu is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Catastropika, and the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Light Ball item.\n\n\nForms\nPikachu has sixteen additional forms that fall into four groups: Cosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, the partner Pikachu, and Gigantamax Pikachu. Additionally, many other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media.\n\nCosplay Pikachu\nCosplay Pikachu is always female, has a black heart-shaped spot at the end of its tail, and can be dressed in any of five outfits corresponding to the five Contest conditions.\n\n\n\n\nCosplay Pikachu\n\nPikachu Rock Star\n\nPikachu Belle\n\nPikachu Pop Star\n\nPikachu, Ph.D\n\nPikachu Libre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPikachu in a cap\nPikachu in a cap is always male and has eight variants, each wearing one of Ash's hats from Pok\u00e9mon the Series. Pikachu in a cap is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. Pikachu in a Cap cannot use Catastropika or Gigantamax.\n\n\n\nOriginal Cap\n\n\n\nHoenn Cap\n\n\n\nSinnoh Cap\n\n\n\nUnova Cap\n\n\n\nKalos Cap\n\n\n\nAlola Cap\n\n\n\nPartner Cap\n\n\n\nWorld Cap\n\n\n\nPartner Pikachu\nThe partner Pikachu is the Pok\u00e9mon the player starts with in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu!. This Pikachu can be either gender. It has higher base stats than normal Pikachu. Unlike other Pikachu, the partner Pikachu can learn the exclusive moves Zippy Zap, Floaty Fall, and Splishy Splash, as well as having access to the Partner Power Pika Papow.\nThe partner Pikachu is not differentiated from standard Pikachu in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!'s Pok\u00e9dex, and it cannot be transferred out of the games.\n\n\n\nPartner Pikachu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGigantamax Pikachu\nAs Gigantamax Pikachu, it becomes larger and chubbier. Its tail becomes longer and becomes capable of storing all of the electricity it generates, causing it to glow a bright yellow and enabling it to become as powerful as a lightning strike. Three red clouds float around the tail. Its power is equal to that of a power plant; however, it is difficult to use it in peoples' homes since Pikachu can only remain in its Gigantamax form for a short time.[2] Gigantamax Pikachu is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Volt Crash.\n\n\n\nGigantamax Pikachu\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nPikachu evolves from Pichu and evolves into Raichu.\nIn Alola, it evolves into Alolan Raichu.\nCosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, Partner Pikachu, and Pikachu with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nPichu\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPikachu\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\u2197\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nRaichu\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2198\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nRaichuAlolan Form\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nAs the player\nMain article: Pikachu (Pok\u00e9Park)\nPikachu appears as the player character in both Pok\u00e9Park Wii: Pikachu's Adventure and its sequel, Pok\u00e9Park 2: Wonders Beyond. He falls down a mysterious tunnel one day with his friends Charmander, Chikorita, and Piplup and ends up in the Pok\u00e9Park. There he goes on a quest to save the Pok\u00e9Park from certain destruction. He later travels to a new Pok\u00e9Park which is being threatened by the ever-expanding Wish Park. At the new Pok\u00e9Park he meets Snivy, Tepig, and Oshawott, and they help to save the Pok\u00e9Park from danger.\n\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Stadium: Pikachu stars in the mini-game \"Thundering Dynamo\" alongside Voltorb. This mini-game involves charging up electric power.\nHey You, Pikachu!: Pikachu stars alongside an unnamed child (who bears a striking resemblance to Red) who was recently taught how to interact with wild Pok\u00e9mon by Professor Oak. The boy and Pikachu form a bond and go on many adventures together, and one day the Pikachu decides to live with the boy.\nPok\u00e9mon Stadium 2: Pikachu can be used in \"Pichu's Power Plant\" if one is detected in a Transferred Pok\u00e9mon game.\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: Pikachu serves as a Ball-Saver, but it will only work if the Lightning Meter is full.\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire: Pikachu has the same role as in Pok\u00e9mon Pinball but is sometimes helped by Pichu. Pikachu also appears on the Catch 'Em Mode banner.\nPok\u00e9mon Channel: Much like Hey You, Pikachu!, Pok\u00e9mon Channel focuses on a boy and a Pikachu bonding through social interactions, such as going outside and talking to other Pok\u00e9mon, and watching TV together.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #025\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nWhen several of these Pok\u00e9mon gather, their electricity could build and cause lightning storms.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nIt keeps its tail raised to monitor its surroundings.

All forms except the partner Pikachu are recognized by an in-game Pok\u00e9dex; partner Pikachu has only been named in promotional materials.[3]\n\nCosplay Pikachu\nCosplay Pikachu is the base form of a group of six interchangeable forms exclusive to Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. It is a female Pikachu who has a black, heart-shaped mark at the end of its tail, obtained from a Pok\u00e9mon Breeder after the player takes part in their first Pok\u00e9mon Contest Spectacular. Cosplay Pikachu can change forms by dressing up in different costumes corresponding to each of the five contest conditions (Coolness, Beauty, Cuteness, Cleverness, and Toughness); each form also automatically learns a move that Pikachu otherwise could not learn. Cosplay Pikachu can change or remove its costume at any Contest Hall, forgetting the move it learned with the last costume (if it still knows it) and learning the move from the new costume (if applicable). If Cosplay Pikachu removes its costume while the only move it knows is the move tied to its costume, it learns Thunder Shock.\nUnlike other Pikachu, Cosplay Pikachu cannot evolve or breed. It also cannot be traded via the GTS or Wonder Trade. Additionally, as it is not present in any games besides Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Cosplay Pikachu cannot be deposited into Pok\u00e9mon Bank, and it does not register as a separate form in Pok\u00e9mon Bank's Pok\u00e9dex, despite it registering separately in the Pok\u00e9dex of Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo costume\n\n\n\n\n\nCosplay Pikachu\u00a0\n\n\nPikachu\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2194\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowsMeteor Mash\n\n\n\n\n\nPikachu Rock Star\u00a0Cool\u00a0\n\n\nPikachu\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2194\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowsIcicle Crash\n\n\n\n\n\nPikachu Belle\u00a0Beautiful\u00a0\n\n\nPikachu\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2194\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowsDraining Kiss\n\n\n\n\n\nPikachu Pop Star\u00a0Cute\u00a0\n\n\nPikachu\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2194\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowsElectric Terrain\n\n\n\n\n\nPikachu, Ph.D\u00a0Clever\u00a0\n\n\nPikachu\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2194\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowsFlying Press\n\n\n\n\n\nPikachu Libre\u00a0Tough\u00a0\n\n\nPikachu\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\nPikachu in a cap\nPikachu in a cap are eight event-exclusive, non-interchangeable forms of Pikachu that debuted in Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon. Like Ash's Pikachu, these Pikachu are always male, and they cannot evolve or breed. They are also able to use the event-exclusive Z-Crystal Pikashunium Z and its corresponding Z-Move 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt. Their cries differ from that of regular Pikachu. They are not present in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, or Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus.\nSix variants exist in Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon, one for each of Ash's hats from the original series to Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon. A seventh variant debuted in Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, wearing the Partner Cap, Ash's hat from Pok\u00e9mon the Movie: I Choose You!. An eighth variant debuted in the Version 1.2.0 update of Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, wearing the World Cap, Ash's hat from Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series.\nThe original six Pikachu in a cap were distributed via serial codes in Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon in celebration of the 20th Pok\u00e9mon movie, and by extension, the 20th anniversary of Pok\u00e9mon the Series. Partner Cap Pikachu was distributed in Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon via a QR Code that can be scanned. All eight Pikachu in a cap (including World Cap Pikachu) were distributed via serial codes in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield to commemorate the TV show's timeslot change to Fridays in Japan; uniquely, the Pikachu from this distribution can learn Volt Tackle from the Move Reminder.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Cap\n\nHoenn Cap\n\nSinnoh Cap\n\nUnova Cap\n\nKalos Cap\n\nAlola Cap\n\nPartner Cap\n\nWorld Cap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner Pikachu\nThe partner Pikachu has a separate internal index from standard Pikachu.

He was the signature Pok\u00e9mon of the animated series from the original series to Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series and appeared in almost every non-special episode and every Pok\u00e9mon movie released throughout that point. In The Climb to Be the Very Best!, he was revealed to be capable of Gigantamaxing. He always remains outside of his Pok\u00e9 Ball.\n\nPikachutwo\nIn Mewtwo Strikes Back, Mewtwo cloned Ash's Pikachu. This Pikachu can be distinguished from Ash's due to the spikes in the black marks found on the tips of its ears. It is also comparatively more aggressive than Ash's Pikachu and slurs its speech, defects possibly caused by Ash tampering with Mewtwo's cloning machine during the cloning process. It reappeared in the sequel special Mewtwo Returns and the remake movie Mewtwo Strikes Back\u2014Evolution.\n\nPuka\nA Pikachu nicknamed Puka was owned by Victor on Seafoam Island in The Pi-Kahuna. This blue-eyed Pikachu saved Ash from drowning by having the ability to sense tidal waves approaching.\n\nSparky\nRitchie has a Pikachu nicknamed Sparky, who debuted in A Friend In Deed. Sparky, unlike most Pikachu, has a tuft of fur on the top of its head, and, unlike Ash's Pikachu, has no problem with living inside a Pok\u00e9 Ball.\n\nAshachu\nAsh was turned into a Pikachu in Hocus Pok\u00e9mon by a Pok\u00e9mon magician named Lily. He reverted to his human form at the beginning of the next episode.\n\nCosplay Pikachu\nAll of the Cosplay Pikachu appeared in Lights! Camera! Pika!, under the ownership of Frank. They reappeared in Hoopa and the Clash of Ages, where they were all summoned by Hoopa as part of a prank on Ash and his Pikachu.\n\nAsh's Pikachu (M20)\nThe Ash Ketchum of the alternate continuity introduced in I Choose You! has a Pikachu of his own.

There are also various Trainer cards with Pikachu in the card's artwork too, including the very sought-after tournament promos such as No.1 Trainer.\nThe first Pikachu that appeared in the TCG was Pikachu in the Base Set (which was reprinted in Base Set 2 and in POP Series 2 with different artwork). It was followed in the next set by another Pikachu (which was also reprinted in the Legendary Collection). The third Pikachu card released was the first-ever English promo card, Pikachu. The original Base Set Pikachu was also released as a special promotional card at E3.\nIn the early days of the TCG, several notable errors were made regarding the Pikachu cards. The Base Set Pikachu was released with altered artwork at first, depicting it with red cheeks, instead of the original yellow. While this matched Ken Sugimori's artwork, the yellow color on its cheeks was intentional by the artist, who depicted Pikachu using ThunderShock. This error appeared in both the E3 promotional version and the normal Base Set release. A second error was made in the production of Jungle set booster packs, which, instead of the Jungle set's Pikachu, sometimes contained first edition versions of the Pikachu that was released as a promo card.\nPikachu has also been featured on a number of TCG coins, with one being included with the English and European languages-only Base Set 2. This coin was also featured in the Pok\u00e9mon Play It! PC game. A Pikachu coin is also featured in the Game Boy game Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, and is one of the coins that can be obtained in Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game 2: The Invasion of Team GR!, where it is given by Isaac to winners of the Lightning Club.\n\nIn the TFG\nTwo Pikachu figures have been released.\n\nNext Quest: Pikachu\nBlack Star Promo: Pikachu\nOther appearances\n Pikachu Libre in Pokk\u00e9n Tournament\n Pikachu in Pok\u00e9mon UNITE\nPokk\u00e9n Tournament\nMain article: Pikachu (Pokk\u00e9n)\nMain article: Pikachu Libre (Pokk\u00e9n)\nPikachu is a Battle Pok\u00e9mon in Pokk\u00e9n Tournament.

They are all known as the Mouse Pok\u00e9mon, though Rattata and Raticate were originally called the Rat Pok\u00e9mon prior to Generation III.\nVeronica Taylor has said Pikachu is her favorite Pok\u00e9mon. Sarah Natochenny has as well, shared with Mew.\nPikachu is the only Pok\u00e9mon that serves as the player's first Pok\u00e9mon in the core series games that has a pre-evolved form. However, Pichu (its pre-evolved form) does not exist in either game in which it fills this role.\nPikachu has the most event-exclusive moves available to it.\nPikachu is the only Pok\u00e9mon with two exclusive Z-Moves.\nWhen starting a new game in Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, Pikachu's front sprite appears with a slightly different color palette (the palette index number 0x10) than usual when it is introduced by Professor Oak. This is the same red/yellow palette used for Mew, Mewtwo, and Jynx (except the Virtual Console Jynx), as well as the battle sprites of all Pok\u00e9mon Trainers.\nDue to the color palette used at the start of Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, Pikachu has red cheeks (in the Game Boy Color) or pink cheeks (in the Super Game Boy). However, in this game's normal gameplay, Pikachu has dark orange cheeks instead.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Yellow and from Generation VI to Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, Pikachu uses its animated series cry (voiced by Ikue Otani). Before Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, it was the only Pok\u00e9mon to do so in the core series games.\nIts battle cry differs from status or Pok\u00e9dex screens.\nThe Pikachu received at the beginning of Pok\u00e9mon Yellow has unique voice clips in Pok\u00e9mon Stadium and Stadium 2.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus and Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet, it uses an updated version of its original cry, like other Pok\u00e9mon.\nPikachu is the only core series first partner Pok\u00e9mon that does not have a 7:1 gender ratio.\nPok\u00e9mon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2 are the only core series games in which Pikachu cannot be obtained without transporting or through an event.\nPikachu is the only not fully evolved Pok\u00e9mon whose base stats increased in Generation VI, as well as the only Pok\u00e9mon to receive more than one stat increase: Defense and Special Defense.\nPikachu is the 25th Pok\u00e9mon in both the National Pok\u00e9dex and Alola Pok\u00e9dex in Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon.\nIn the Japanese Pok\u00e9mon Stadium, Pikachu is the only usable Pok\u00e9mon that is not fully evolved.\nPikachu is the only Pok\u00e9mon that can be caught in all three pinball titles: Pok\u00e9mon Pinball, Pok\u00e9mon Pinball mini, and Pok\u00e9mon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire.\nAccording to A Sneak Peek at Pok\u00e9mon, Pikachu can deliver a constant current of 1000 amperes.\nPikachu is currently represented in the Trading Card Game by more cards than any other Pok\u00e9mon, with 212 unique cards.\nOn December 11, 2023, Google revealed that Pikachu was the \"most searched Pok\u00e9mon\" in the platform's history during its 25 years of creation.[5][6]\nMerchandise\n Pikachu in Pok\u00e9mon Battle Chess\nPikachu appears in Pok\u00e9mon Battle Chess. It doesn't behave like any traditional piece in chess but behaves like a gold general in shogi.\nPikachu was the focus of a Pok\u00e9mon Center collection in June 2014.\nReal life\nThe Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade has included three Pikachu balloons. \"Flying Pikachu\" was the first, flown from 2001 to 2005, and was used in a morning rush hour test of wind conditions in Times Square after an accident involving an M&M's balloon in the 2005 parade.[7] It was last used in the August 2006 Party of the Decade in New York City's Bryant Park. The second balloon debuted in the 2006 parade, features glowing cheeks, and chases a Pok\u00e9 Ball balloon. The third, introduced in the 2014 parade, wears a green scarf and holds a small, Pikachu-shaped snowman.\nCultural impact\n $1 coin from Niue featuring Pikachu\nThe nation of Niue released a one-dollar coin with its coat of arms on one side and Pikachu on the other to promote the Pok\u00e9mon franchise.\nPikachu has served as the inspiration for the naming of several scientific discoveries:\nIn 2008, Japanese researchers discovered a new protein that helps carry electrical impulses from the eyes to the brain and named it pikachurin. According to them, it was so named for sharing Pikachu's \"lightning-fast moves and shocking electric effects\".\nThe springtail species Dicranocentrus pikachu was named after Pikachu.[8]\nThe spider species Epicratinus pikachu was named after Pikachu due to the female spider's epigynum resembling its face.[9]\nThe spider species Alistra pikachu was named after Pikachu due to its yellow coloration.[10]\nThe beetle species Hiperantha pikachu was named after Pikachu because of its yellow elytra with a black apical band that resembles Pikachu's ears.[11]\nConcept and development\nPikachu was designed by Atsuko Nishida, a core designer at Game Freak.[12][13] Pikachu had a short, stout design during the initial release of Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green, but its design was altered for Pok\u00e9mon the Series and subsequent entries of the games, becoming slightly taller and skinnier. According to Ken Sugimori, Pikachu's design was altered to make animating its actions easier.[13] Pikachu is depicted with a white belly similar to its evolved form Raichu in the Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards as seen here.\nPikachu also originally had a second-stage evolution named \"Gorochu\" (Japanese: \u30b4\u30ed\u30c1\u30e5\u30a6 Goroch\u016b), which would have had two horns and fangs.[14][15] Sugimori stated that while there was nothing wrong with its appearance, it was nonetheless omitted from Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green, as the staff found that the game balance was better without it, and the limited game space meant that some Pok\u00e9mon originally designed to evolve twice were changed to evolve only once.[13]\nGigantamax Pikachu was designed by James Turner.[16]\n\nOrigin\nPikachu was originally a daifuku-like creature with ears sticking out. Its black ear tips are remnants of this original concept.[13][15]\nNishida named the Pok\u00e9mon Pikachu \"without giving it much thought\", and while it wasn't originally intended to be based on a mouse, Game Freak CEO Satoshi Tajiri made the decision to base it on such. During the process of making Pikachu \"cuter\", as per the instructions of game designer K\u014dji Nishino, Nishida added cheek pouches for it to store electricity in. These were inspired by squirrels, which store food in their cheeks. Pikachu's yellow coloration and lightning bolt-shaped tail were given to express Pikachu's electrical attributes and make its type easier to recognise and understand.
