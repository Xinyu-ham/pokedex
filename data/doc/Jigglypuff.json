It has pointed ears with black insides and large, blue eyes. It has small, stubby arms and slightly longer feet. On top of its head is a curled tuft of fur. Its body is filled with air and, as seen in Pok\u00e9mon Stadium, Jigglypuff can deflate until it is flat. It can float by drawing extra air into its body, as demonstrated in Super Smash Bros.\nJigglypuff can use its eyes to mesmerize opponents. It has a large lung capacity, exceeding most other Pok\u00e9mon. Once it has an opponent's attention, Jigglypuff will inflate its lungs and begin to sing a soothing and mysterious lullaby. This melody can cause anyone who listens to become sleepy. If the opponent resists falling asleep, Jigglypuff will endanger its own life by continuing to sing until it runs out of air. It will continue to sing until the opponent is asleep. It can adjust the wavelength of its voice to match the brain waves of someone in a deep sleep. This helps ensure drowsiness in its opponents. Its vocal range exceeds 12 octaves, but its skill depends on the individual. Its song varies by region, and in some areas, it sounds like shouting. Jigglypuff can mostly be found in lush green plains and grassy meadows. Scream Tail shares a resemblance to Jigglypuff. It is believed Scream Tail is Jigglypuff's ancestor from 1,000,000,000 years ago. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Jigglypuff is known to sing even when sleeping.[1]\n\nEvolution\nJigglypuff evolves from Igglybuff and evolves into Wigglytuff.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nIgglybuff\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nJigglypuff\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nWigglytuff\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #039\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nWhen its huge eyes light up, it sings a mysteriously soothing melody that lulls its enemies to sleep.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nUses its alluring eyes to enrapture its foe.

From this episode through the end of the original series, it followed Ash and his friends, intent on performing its trademark song without causing its audience to fall asleep.

Jigglypuff would scribble all over the faces of anyone who fell asleep after hearing the song.\nAfter Johto, Jigglypuff started to only appear very rarely, being featured in one early Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode. After a long absence, Jigglypuff reappeared in Alola, Kanto! and When Regions Collide!, where it was seen sleeping on top of the plane that Ash and his classmates were flying on back to Alola, and made semi-regular appearances in Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon.

One of them was seen singing in a bar that Tim Goodman and Detective Pikachu went to for leads.\n\n\nTrivia\nJigglypuff is typically depicted in the Super Smash Bros. series and Ken Sugimori's artwork with green eyes and tea rose pink fur, more closely resembling its Shiny form. It also appeared with green eyes in Rough, Tough Jigglypuff and The Legend of Thunder!.\nDue to an oversight, Jigglypuff appears purple (instead of pink) in the battle against Gengar in the intro of Pok\u00e9mon Blue (including the Japanese version). This is a leftover from the earlier Japanese games Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green, when two purple Pok\u00e9mon battled instead: Gengar vs. Nidorino (which is also seen in the international versions of Pok\u00e9mon Red).\nJigglypuff and its evolutionary relatives share their category name with Qwilfish and Drifloon. They are all known as the Balloon Pok\u00e9mon.\nOrigin\nJigglypuff seems to be based on a balloon due to its inflatable body. Its soft fur and singing ability may be based on plush toys that play music to help children fall asleep. Its round shape resembles a powder puff or a cream puff, and its pink color, rubbery skin, and ability to learn Bounce are similar to a rubber ball. It may also be inspired by the mythical moon rabbit due to its evolved form Wigglytuff's large ears; Fairy type, which tends to be associated with the moon; and the fact that it evolves using a Moon Stone.\n\nName origin\nJigglypuff may be a combination of jiggly and puff (to swell in size; a burst of air).\nPurin may refer to \u30d7\u30ea\u30f3 purin (pudding; referring to its soft body). It may also involve \u30d7\u30c1 puchi (petite) and pretty.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3 Purin\n\nFrom \u30d7\u30ea\u30f3 purin, \u30d7\u30c1 puchi, and pretty\n\n\n French\n\nRondoudou\n\nFrom rond, doux, doudou, and roudoudou\n\n\n Spanish\n\nJigglypuff\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nPummeluff\n\nFrom pummelig and fluff\n\n\n Italian\n\nJigglypuff\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ud478\ub9b0 Purin\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u80d6\u4e01 P\u00e0ngd\u012bng\n\nFrom \u80d6 p\u00e0ng and \u5e03\u4e01 b\u00f9d\u012bng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u80d6\u4e01 Buhnd\u012bng*\u6ce2\u6ce2\u7403 B\u014db\u014dk\u00e0uh*\n\nFrom \u80d6 buhn and \u5e03\u4e01 boud\u012bngFrom \u6ce2 b\u014d and \u7403 k\u00e0uh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Greek\n\n\u03a4\u03b6\u03af\u03b3\u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c6 Tz\u00edglipuf\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d2'\u05d9\u05d2\u05dc\u05d9\u05e4\u05d0\u05e3 Jigglipaff\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u091c\u093f\u0917\u094d\u0932\u0940\u092a\u092b\u093c Jigglypuff\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nD\u017eiglipafas\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0414\u0436\u0438\u0433\u0433\u043b\u0438\u043f\u0430\u0444\u0444 Dzhigglipaff\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e1e\u0e39\u0e23\u0e34\u0e19 Phurin\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nJigglypuff (anime)\nJiggly\nJigglypuff (MPJ)\nWigglytuff (UNITE)\nJigglypuff (Super Smash Bros.)\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\nExternal links\nArticle on Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Smash Bros. series\n\n\nGames:\n\nSuper Smash Bros. \u2022 Super Smash Bros.
