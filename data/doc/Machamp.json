It has bluish-gray skin, red eyes, and large, pale, yellow lips. On its head, there are three brown ridges right above its eyes. It has two arms on each side of its body: a pair located in the normal position, and another pair directly above that attaches on the top of the shoulders. It has black markings that resemble briefs and wears a golden power-save belt that resembles a championship belt. Its legs have considerable muscle tone, and its feet have two toes each.\nMachamp are said to know every martial arts style in the world. It punches extremely quickly, throwing 500 punches a second. With only one hand, it can move a mountain. In Generation VII, Strength was its signature move. Because of its four arms, it can hit from a multitude of angles and pin all of its foe's limbs down at once. Its arms also allow it to attack and defend simultaneously. The four arms react much faster than Machamp can think. However, it has poor dexterity, and cannot handle delicate work without its arms becoming tangled. The belt it wears restricts its muscle activity, but it can cause consequences if removed. Being the result of an evolution via trading, Machamp is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in the mountains. In Alola, Machamp is used as a Ride Pok\u00e9mon called Machamp Shove, where Marchamp carries humans on its arms while moving large rocks out fo the way.\nIn Generation II, Vital Throw was its signature move.\n\n\nForms\nMachamp has a Gigantamax form.\nAs Gigantamax Machamp, it swells to enormous proportions and acquires immeasurable strength. Due to Gigantamaxing, its arms are filled with Gigantamax energy, making its punches as hard as bomb blasts. Its bluish-gray skin becomes darker. The ridges on its head are also darker, with the middle ridge becoming longer. Its eyes become bright yellow. The neck extends with black markings. The four fists are now dark orange, with orange-yellow veins connecting to two orange spots on each arm. The belt extends with several more notches. The black markings now extend down the legs and stop above the ankles. Three red clouds circle around its waist.\nGigantamax Machamp is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Chi Strike.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGigantamax Machamp\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nMachamp evolves from Machoke and is the final form of Machop.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nMachop\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nMachoke\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nMachamp\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #068\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nUsing its heavy muscles, it throws powerful punches that can send the victim clear over the horizon.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nOne arm alone can move mountains.

They are both the last stage of a three-part evolutionary line, they reach their final stage by trading, level up at a Medium Slow rate, and they both have a 75% male gender ratio. Also, Machamp excels at the Attack stat, while Alakazam excels at the Special Attack stat. Their evolutionary lines are also next to each other in the National Pok\u00e9dex. Moreover, a girl in Oreburgh City will trade her Abra for a Machop. Additionally, their base friendship is the same at 70, and all Pok\u00e9mon in both of their respective evolutionary lines are in the Human-Like egg group. Finally, while Machamp has a Gigantamax form, Alakazam has a Mega Evolution.\nMachamp also can be seen as a counterpart to the Conkeldurr evolutionary line. Both of them are Fighting-type Pok\u00e9mon whose Attack is their highest stat. They both have below average speed. They share the same base stat total. They both have same gender ratio, they both have three-evolutionary stages, and they both reach their respective final-evolutionary stage through trading.\nBesides Alakazam and Conkeldurr, Machamp can also be seen as a counterpart to Gengar. All four Pok\u00e9mon can be obtained through evolution induced by trade. Gengar and Machamp are also capable of Gigantamaxing starting in Generation VIII and belong to two Gym Leaders in the Galar region, depending on which game is played; Machamp belongs to Bea in Pok\u00e9mon Sword, while Gengar belongs to Allister in Pok\u00e9mon Shield.\nMachamp's Japanese name, Kairiky, is similar to the Japanese name of the move Strength.\nAdditionally, in Mandarin and Cantonese Chinese, Machamp shares its name with Strength; \u602a\u529b Gu\u00e0il\u00ec and \u602a\u529b Gwaailihk respectively.\nOrigin\nMachamp appears to be based on a bodybuilder or wrestler. Seeing as it has more than two arms and blue skin, Machamp might also be based on a Hindu god, perhaps Shiva or Vishnu. Its Shiny variant's green coloration may have been inspired by the Incredible Hulk.\nGigantamax Machamp, appearance-wise, resembles the general depictions of the giants from the Ultra series, especially with its eyes and head ornaments. These particular warriors are protectors of the universe and often could only be gigantic for a limited time (much like Dynamax as a whole).\n\nName origin\nMachamp may be a combination of macho (manly; Spanish and Portuguese for male) and champ.\nKairiky may be derived from \u602a\u529b kairiki (superhuman strength), which is the name of its category in Japanese.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30ab\u30a4\u30ea\u30ad\u30fc Kairiky\n\nFrom \u602a\u529b kairiki\n\n\n French\n\nMackogneur\n\nFrom macho and cogneur\n\n\n Spanish\n\nMachamp\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nMachomei\n\nFrom Greek \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 m\u00e1chomai or Macho and Meister\n\n\n Italian\n\nMachamp\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uad34\ub825\ubaac Goeryeokmon\n\nFrom \uad34\ub825 (\u602a\u529b) goeryeok and monster\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u602a\u529b Gu\u00e0il\u00ec\n\nFrom \u602a\u529b gu\u00e0il\u00ec\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u602a\u529b Gwaailihk\n\nFrom \u602a\u529b gwaailihk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05de\u05d0\u05e6'\u05d0\u05de\u05e4 Machamp\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092e\u091a\u0948\u092e\u094d\u092a Machamp\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041c\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043c\u043f Machamp\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e44\u0e04\u0e23\u0e34\u0e01\u0e35 Khairiki\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nBlue's Machamp\nMachamp (MPJ)\nMachamp (Pokk\u00e9n)\nMachamp (UNITE)\nGigantamax\nExternal links\n\n Gigantamax forms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0067: Machoke\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0069: Bellsprout\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Machamp_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128502\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monFighting-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of three males to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Slow experience groupGray-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 12 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with different formsHuman-Like group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hoenn Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Sinnoh Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hisui Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 505Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon whose base Attack stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon with 16 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are included in the Japan-only Pok\u00e9mon Stadium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 16:22.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
