It has a puckered tan beak, small eyes, and two lumps on its forehead with a yellow flame on top of each one. Rigid, red scales cover its arms and it has five, clawed fingers on each hand. Magmar's shoulders and thighs are yellow, and its red feet have two, clawed toes each. It has black, metal shackles around its neck and ankles. Down its back is a row of red spikes, and there is a flame at the tip of its tapering, yellow tail.\nMagmar's body temperature is nearly 2,200\u00b0 Fahrenheit (1,200\u00b0 Celsius), giving its body an orange glow. Because it hates cold places, this Pok\u00e9mon typically resides in and around active volcanoes where it is born from. This Pok\u00e9mon has even been known to spit scorching flames to establish an ideally warm environment for itself. The Magmar found in Alola are said to be sturdier than Magmar found elsewhere.\nIn battle, Magmar blows out intense flames from all over its body to intimidate its foes and incinerate its surroundings. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Riddle Me This has shown that extremely well-trained Magmar can block Electric-type attacks with super-heated air. However, an outmatched Magmar will quickly retreat, using its fiery camouflage and its wavering, rippling glare to blend into any present fires. As stated in the 23rd chapter of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, Magmar is very persistent and will hunt down anyone who manages to defeat it. It is able to heal its wounds and weariness by soaking in lava. Magmar has a bad habit of unintentionally burning its prey to a crisp. Its body is always constantly burning. Magmar is feared as one of the many causes of fires.\n\nEvolution\nMagmar evolves from Magby and evolves into Magmortar.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nMagby\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nMagmar\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nMagmortar\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9mon Super Mystery Dungeon: Four Magmar along with Magmortar are the boss Pok\u00e9mon at Fire Island Volcano.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #126\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nIts body always burns with an orange glow that enables it to hide perfectly among flames.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nBorn in an active volcano.

They both have similar status-inducing Abilities (Flame Body and Static), as well as the same Hidden Ability, Vital Spirit. Since Generation V, they also often learn similar moves at the same level. They even have the same special moves when purified in Pok\u00e9mon XD: Follow Me and Cross Chop. Their evolutionary relatives were released in the same generation (Generation II and IV). Both also appear to be based on beings from Japanese mythology; Magmar has similarities to the Karura and Electabuzz has similarities to the oni.\nMagmar was featured in the tenth episode of Beyond the Pok\u00e9dex series.\nDesign variations\nMagmar was originally depicted with four fingers in its Generation I artwork and its sprites for the first three generations, except for Pok\u00e9mon Yellow. It otherwise consistently has five fingers across official media.\n\n\n\n\n\nRed and Green art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed and Blue art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey art\n\n\n\n\nOrigin\nMagmar seems to be a combination of a booby or duck with a mythical salamander of fire. However, the tail and the spikes on its back resemble those of an iguana. It is possibly overall based on a Karura, depicted in Japanese Hindu-Buddhist mythology as a birdlike, fire-breathing creature.
