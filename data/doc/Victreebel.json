It has a gaping mouth with pink lips and two sharp teeth. Its semicircular eyes appear directly under its mouth and it has several dark green spots on its body. On either side of its body is a large green leaf. Covering Victreebel's mouth is a leaf with a long, brown, yellow-tipped vine growing out of it. The vine is flicked to mimic an animal in order to attract prey. Victreebel also produces a sweet scent to further aid in luring its victims. Acid that has dissolved numerous prey animals becomes sweeter and even more effective at attracting prey.\nIt can be found in small groups and is territorial. In the 22nd chapter of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, Victreebel hoards food, usually small birds and rodents, and collects Leaf Stones to perform Evolution rituals at night to help Weepinbell become more Victreebel. Being the result of exposure to an Evolution stone, Victreebel is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in temperate forests and jungles. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Victreebel is known to sleep with its mouth open to draw in prey.[1] Very rarely, it forgets about luring in prey and instead chooses to sleep face down.\n\nEvolution\nVictreebel evolves from Weepinbell and is the final form of Bellsprout.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nBellsprout\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nWeepinbell\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nVictreebel\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #071\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nSaid to live in huge colonies deep in jungles, although no one has ever returned from there.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nLures prey with the sweet aroma of honey.
