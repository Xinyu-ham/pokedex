It has large, grayish-green eyes and a round snout with small nostrils. A pair of long, thin antennae sprout from the top of its head with a small horn set between them. Its striated underbelly is cream-colored and extends from its neck to the tip of its long, tapering tail. It has thick arms and legs ending in three claws each. The leg joints are well defined, while its arms have a smooth, rounded appearance. Dragonite's wings are small relative to its body with teal wing membranes.\nDespite its bulky build, Dragonite is capable of flying faster than the speed of sound, being able to circle the globe in sixteen hours. A kindhearted Pok\u00e9mon with human-like intelligence, Dragonite shows signs of altruism: it is said to save humans from drowning and lead lost or foundering ships to safety. As demonstrated in Great Bowls of Fire!, however, it will go on an uncontrollable, destructive rampage if its environment is threatened. Dragonite will usually calm down and be satisfied after smashing down anything that has angered it to smithereens. It is known to engage in fierce battles with Kingdra whenever they meet. Dragonite has been referred to as the \"sea guardian\" and the \"Sea Incarnate\"; as such, there are many ships with figureheads decorated with Dragonite's look. Drayden stated in Thrash of the Titans! that Dragonite's power is capable of affecting the weather. In Fiore, Dragonite used by Pok\u00e9mon Rangers to travel to different areas in the region, this flying service is called the Dragonite Bus.\nDragonite is very rare in the wild, typically living near the sea. Some claim that there is an island somewhere in the ocean that only Dragonite inhabit. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Dragonite is known to sleep soundly while displaying its belly.[1] This rare sight is said to be an exhausted Dragonite resting after flying over the vast seas.\nIn Generation II, Dragonite and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Outrage, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding.\n\nEvolution\nDragonite evolves from Dragonair and is the final form of Dratini.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nDratini\u00a0Dragon\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nDragonair\u00a0Dragon\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nDragonite\u00a0Dragon\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Ranger: After the sixth mission, it is possible to use the Dragonite Bus.

In all later games, its catch rate was changed back to 45.\nKingdra's Pok\u00e9dex entry in Pok\u00e9mon Sword mentions Dragonite, which was unavailable prior to the release of the second expansion of the game, The Crown Tundra.\nDragonite is the only species owned by one of Ash's friends that Ash himself would later catch.\nDue to Dragonite's learnset not being in numerical order in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, Dragonite cannot learn Outrage at level 41 and must be taught via the Move Reminder instead.\nDragonite and Salamence have the highest base stat total of all Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon (excluding Mega Evolutions and Legendary Pok\u00e9mon).\nOrigin\nDragonite resembles Japanese dragons, European dragons, or fairy dragons. Its description as the \"guardian of the sea\" may also suggest it has elements similar to the Chinese dragon.\n\nName origin\nDragonite may be a combination of dragon and knight, night, or draconite (a mythical stone said to be found in the heads of dragons and are pyramidal in shape, similar to Dragonite's horn).\nKairyu may be from \u6d77\u7adc kairy\u016b (sea dragon). It may also involve \u602a\u7363 kaij\u016b (monster), \u5feb kai (cheerful), and \u7834\u58ca hakai (destruction).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30ab\u30a4\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc Kairyu\n\nFrom \u6d77\u7adc kairy\u016b and possibly \u602a\u7363 kaij\u016b, \u5feb kai, or \u7834\u58ca hakai\n\n\n French\n\nDracolosse\n\nFrom Draco and colosse\n\n\n Spanish\n\nDragonite\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nDragoran\n\nFrom dragon and randalieren\n\n\n Italian\n\nDragonite\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub9dd\ub098\ub1fd Mangnanyong\n\nFrom \ub9dd\ub9dd\ub300\ud574 (\u832b\u832b\u5927\u6d77) mangmangdaehae, \ub0a0\ub2e4 nalda, and \uc6a9 (\u9f8d) yong\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5feb\u9f8d / \u5feb\u9f99 Ku\u00e0il\u00f3ng\n\nFrom \u5feb ku\u00e0i and \u9f8d / \u9f99 l\u00f3ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5feb\u9f8d Faail\u00f9hng*\u555f\u66b4\u9f8d K\u00e1ibouhl\u00f9hng*\n\nFrom \u5feb faai and \u9f8d l\u00f9hngPossibly from \u555f k\u00e1i, \u66b4 bouh or \u66b4\u98a8 bouhf\u016bng, \u66b4\u9f8d bouhl\u00f9hng, and \u9f8d l\u00f9hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d3\u05e8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05d9\u05d8 Dragonayt\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0921\u094d\u0930\u0948\u0917\u0928\u093e\u0907\u091f Dragonite\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0414\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442 Dragonayt\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e44\u0e04\u0e23\u0e34\u0e27 Khairio\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nDrake's Dragonite\nLance's Dragonite\nAsh's Dragonite\nIris's Dragonite\nDragonite (UNITE)\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\nExternal links\n\nPseudo-legendary Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0148: Dragonair\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0150: Mewtwo\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Dragonite_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4144762\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monDragon-type Pok\u00e9monFlying-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Slow experience groupBrown-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 06 Pok\u00e9monWater 1 group Pok\u00e9monDragon group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 600Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became both Special Attack and Special DefensePok\u00e9mon whose base Attack stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon with 22 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monShadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XDPok\u00e9mon that are included in the Japan-only Pok\u00e9mon Stadium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 13 October 2024, at 11:58.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
