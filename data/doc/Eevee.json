Refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data for these details.)\nAdditionally, Eevee has two forms: the partner Eevee and Gigantamax Eevee. It can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Eevee if it has the Gigantamax Factor. The partner Eevee and Eevee with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve.\nEevee is the game mascot of and the player's first Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Eevee!. It also serves as the player's first Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XD: Gale of Darkness and Pok\u00e9mon Conquest. It also is the first Pok\u00e9mon employee in Pok\u00e9mon Caf\u00e9 Mix. In Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, Professor Oak had originally intended to give Eevee to the player as their first Pok\u00e9mon, but it is taken by Blue instead.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biology\n\n1.1 Forms\n\n1.1.1 Partner Eevee\n1.1.2 Gigantamax Eevee\n\n\n1.2 Evolution\n\n\n2 Game data\n\n2.1 NPC appearances\n2.2 Pok\u00e9dex entries\n2.3 Game locations\n\n2.3.1 In side games\n2.3.2 In events\n\n2.3.2.1 In-game events\n2.3.2.2 Wild Area News\n2.3.2.3 Pok\u00e9 Portal News\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Held items\n2.5 Stats\n\n2.5.1 Base stats\n\n2.5.1.1 Partner Eevee\n\n\n2.5.2 Pok\u00e9athlon stats\n\n\n2.6 Type effectiveness\n2.7 Learnset\n\n2.7.1 By leveling up\n2.7.2 By TM\n2.7.3 By breeding\n2.7.4 TCG-only moves\n\n\n2.8 Side game data\n2.9 Form data\n\n2.9.1 Partner Eevee\n2.9.2 Gigantamax\n\n\n2.10 Evolution data\n2.11 Sprites\n\n\n3 In animation\n\n3.1 Main series\n\n3.1.1 Major appearances\n\n3.1.1.1 May's Eevee\n3.1.1.2 Serena's Eevee\n3.1.1.3 Sandy\n3.1.1.4 Gary's Eevee\n3.1.1.5 Sakura's Eevee\n3.1.1.6 Gladion's Eevee\n3.1.1.7 Chloe's Eevee\n3.1.1.8 Other\n\n\n3.1.2 Minor appearances\n3.1.3 Pok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n3.2 Pok\u00e9mon Origins\n3.3 Pok\u00e9mon: Twilight Wings\n3.4 GOTCHA!\n3.5 POK\u00c9TOON\n\n\n4 In the manga\n\n4.1 The Electric Tale of Pikachu\n4.2 Magical Pok\u00e9mon Journey\n4.3 Pok\u00e9mon Adventures\n\n4.3.1 Red, Green & Blue arc\n4.3.2 Yellow arc\n4.3.3 Gold, Silver & Crystal arc\n4.3.4 FireRed & LeafGreen arc\n4.3.5 X & Y arc\n4.3.6 Sword & Shield arc\n4.3.7 Pok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n4.4 Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl Adventure!\n4.5 Pok\u00e9mon: Yeah!

The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose.\nEevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found in cities and towns. It is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats by evolving. Eevee can potentially evolve into eight different Evolutions. Eevee can also start to adopt the face of the Trainer that owns it. Eevee's genes are believed to have the key to solving the mysteries of Pok\u00e9mon Evolution. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Eevee is believed to dream about which form it will evolve into.[1]\nEevee is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Extreme Evoboost.\n\nForms\nEevee has two forms: the partner Eevee and Gigantamax Eevee.\n\nPartner Eevee\nThe partner Eevee has purple eyes and a lighter shade of fur. These design elements were likely taken from Pok\u00e9mon the Series, which implemented similar traits starting in Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire. The partner Eevee has higher base stats and access to moves that normal Eevee do not. The white tip on a female partner Eevee's tail has larger, rounder scallops than other Eevee. Before Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, this trait was unique and wasn't found on other female Eevee. Since Sword and Shield, however, the unique tail pattern is present on all female Eevee as a true gender difference. As a result, Pok\u00e9mon GO was updated to apply this change to all female Eevee as well.\nThe partner Eevee is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the moves Bouncy Bubble, Buzzy Buzz, Sizzly Slide, Glitzy Glow, Baddy Bad, Sappy Seed, Freezy Frost, and Sparkly Swirl, as well as the partner power Veevee Volley.\n\nGigantamax Eevee\nAs Gigantamax Eevee, it has become larger and more fluffy. The fur collar becomes longer with several triangular furs pointing straight up. The right ear has three red clouds circling it. Due to the fur becoming fluffier and more luxurious, any enemies caught in it will become enamored and lose the will to fight. Eevee becomes even more playful and rambunctious after Gigantamaxing, desiring to play with its opponent and often unintentionally crushing them with its size.[2]\nGigantamax Eevee is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Cuddle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner Eevee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGigantamax Eevee\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nEevee can evolve into eight different Pok\u00e9mon (collectively called Eeveelutions).\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nVaporeon\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nJolteon\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nFlareon\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nEspeon\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\u2196\n\u2191\n\u2197\n\u2190\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nEevee\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\u2199\n\u2193\n\u2198\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nUmbreon\u00a0Dark\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nLeafeon\u00a0Grass\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nGlaceon\u00a0Ice\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nSylveon\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Stadium 2: Eevee stars in the mini-game \"Eager Eevee\".\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #133\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nIts genetic code is irregular.

It has higher base stats than normal Eevee. Unlike other Eevee, the partner Eevee can learn the exclusive moves Bouncy Bubble, Buzzy Buzz, Sizzly Slide, Glitzy Glow, Baddy Bad, Sappy Seed, Freezy Frost, and Sparkly Swirl, as well as having access to the partner power Veevee Volley.\nThe partner Eevee is not differentiated from standard Eevee in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!'s Pok\u00e9dex, and it cannot be transferred out of the games.\n\n\n\nPartner Eevee\n\n\n\n\nGigantamax\nGigantamax Eevee can only be obtained through special methods, and the Gigantamax Factor cannot be bred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGigantamax Factor\n\n\n\n\n\nEevee\n\n\nEevee\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\nDynamax Band\n\n\u2194\n\n\n\n\n\nLasts for three turns\n\n\n\n\n\nGigantamaxEevee\n\n\nEevee\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nEvolution data\nEevee can evolve into eight different Pok\u00e9mon (collectively called Eeveelutions).\nEevee can always evolve into Vaporeon, Jolteon, or Flareon when exposed to a Water Stone, Thunder Stone, or Fire Stone, respectively.\nSince Generation II, Eevee can evolve into Espeon or Umbreon when leveled up with high friendship (220 before Generation VIII or 160 since) during the day/night, respectively. In a few games without a clock, it cannot evolve into Espeon or Umbreon; in Pok\u00e9mon XD only, Eevee will evolve if the player has the Sun Shard/Moon Shard in their Bag.\nSince Generation IV, Eevee can evolve into Leafeon or Glaceon when it levels up near a Moss Rock or Ice Rock, respectively. Not all games have Moss and Ice Rocks, so since Generation VIII, Eevee can also evolve into Leafeon or Glaceon when exposed to a Leaf Stone or Ice Stone.\nSince Generation VI, Eevee can evolve into Sylveon if it knows a Fairy-type move and has high affection (at least two levels) when it levels up. Since affection was folded into friendship in Generation VIII, it can evolve if its friendship is at least 160 instead.\nIf multiple evolutionary conditions are met simultaneously, Leafeon and Glaceon are prioritized over Sylveon, and Sylveon is prioritized over Espeon and Umbreon.\nThe partner Eevee and Eevee with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve. Since Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! only include the first 151 Pok\u00e9mon, wild Eevee can only evolve into Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon in those games. Similarly, Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl does not contain Sylveon.\n\n\n\nThis table primarily describes the latest games; for earlier games, check eligibility below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nEevee\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\nWater Stone\u2193\n\nThunder Stone\u2193\n\nFire Stone\u2193\n\nFriendship(day)\u2193\n\nFriendship(night)\u2193\n\n\n\n\nLevel up:near Moss Rock\n\n\u2193\n\nLeaf Stone\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel up:near Ice Rock\n\n\u2193\n\nIce Stone\u00a0\n\n\n + Level up:Friendship and aFairy-type move\u2193\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nVaporeon\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nJolteon\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nFlareon\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nEspeon\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nUmbreon\u00a0Dark\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nLeafeon\u00a0Grass\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nGlaceon\u00a0Ice\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nSylveon\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\nThis table describes the changes in Evolution eligibility in different games.\n\n\n\n\n\nVaporeon\n\nJolteon\n\nFlareon\n\nEspeon\n\nUmbreon\n\nLeafeon\n\nGlaceon\n\nSylveon\n\n\nRBY\n\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGSC\n\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\n\n\n\n\nRSE\n\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\n\n\n\n\nFRLG/Colo\n\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2718\n\u2718\n\n\n\n\n\nXD\n\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\nSun Shard\nMoon Shard\n\n\n\n\n\nDPPt\n\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n Moss Rock\n Ice Rock\n\n\n\nHGSS\n\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2718\n\u2718\n\n\n\nBWB2W2\n\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n Moss Rock\n Ice Rock\n\n\n\nXYORASSMUSUM\n\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n Moss Rock\n Ice Rock\nAffection\n\n\nPE\n\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2718\n\u2718\n\u2718\n\u2718\n\u2718\n\n\nSwSh\n\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u00a0Leaf Stone\n\u00a0Ice Stone\nFriendship\n\n\nBDSP\n\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n Moss Rock\u00a0Leaf Stone\n Ice Rock\n\u2718\n\n\nLA\n\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n Moss Rock\u00a0Leaf Stone\n Ice Rock\u00a0Ice Stone\nFriendship\n\n\nSV\n\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\u00a0Leaf Stone\n\u00a0Ice Stone\nFriendship\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSprites\n\n\n\n\nThis template is incomplete.Please feel free to edit this template to add missing information and complete it.

It also appears as a trophy in both versions of the game.\n\nTrophy information\nNA: This Normal-type Pok\u00e9mon is as adaptable to evolution as they come, with eight evolutions discovered thus far. If you pair that potential with its adorable features, it's no wonder Eevee is so popular! In Smash Bros., Eevee will attack a nearby opponent with Take Down. Sadly, this attack isn't incredibly powerful. \nPAL: This adorable Normal-type Pok\u00e9mon's ability to evolve in so many different ways makes it a popular choice with trainers. When brought out in battle, Eevee uses Take Down on the first opponent it sees, but...it's not very effective. Never mind. Eevee may not be the toughest Pok\u00e9mon, but it'll always be one of the cutest. \n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nEevee returns as a Pok\u00e9 Ball Pok\u00e9mon retaining the same behavior from the previous game. It also appears as two Spirits, Eevee and Partner Eevee.\n\nPOK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu\nAn Eevee briefly appeared in POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu, under the ownership of Howard Clifford. It evolved into a Flareon.\n\nCelestial\nEevee appeared in the music video for Celestial.\n\n\nTrivia\nEevee's English name is a palindrome.\nEevee's English name also contains only two unique characters, less than any other Pok\u00e9mon's English name.\nIt is one of five Pok\u00e9mon whose English name is palindromic, with the other four being Girafarig, Ho-Oh, Alomomola, and Farigiraf.\nEevee was designed by Motofumi Fujiwara.[4][5]\nEevee has the most branched Evolutions, with a total of eight.\nEevee has the most evolved forms of any Pok\u00e9mon and is the only Pok\u00e9mon that has more than four evolved forms.\nEevee is the only Pok\u00e9mon that evolves with a Leaf Stone that is not a Grass-type, as well as the only one to evolve by Water Stone that is not a Water-type.\nThe fan-made term to describe the Evolutions of Eevee, Eeveelutions, was made official after its use in the strategy guide for Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2, followed by a TCG Theme Deck.\nIn early English promotional material for Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, Eevee was called \"Eon\", the suffix of all of the evolved forms of Eevee.\nIn Generation I, Eevee was the only Pok\u00e9mon to have a branched Evolution.\nEevee is the only Pok\u00e9mon capable of evolving further that cannot evolve into a Pok\u00e9mon that it shares at least one type with (though Azurill shared this trait prior to it and Marill gaining the Fairy-type in Generation VI).\nPok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen and Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver are the only core series titles to have the methods of Evolution required for some included Pok\u00e9mon be completely unavailable, and Eevee is the only Pok\u00e9mon impacted in both cases.\nDespite Eevee being obtainable before the Pok\u00e9mon League and Leafeon and Glaceon being included in the Unova regional Pok\u00e9dex in Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2, it cannot evolve into them until after entering the Hall of Fame. This is because Twist Mountain and Pinwheel Forest are inaccessible before then.\nEevee is the only pre-existing Pok\u00e9mon to receive an Evolution in Generation VI, though many received Mega Evolutions.\nFour of Eevee's evolved forms evolve through abnormal means in the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon series (Espeon, Umbreon, Leafeon, and Glaceon).\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon series, Eevee evolves using the Sun Ribbon or Lunar Ribbon with at least 1 star of IQ, a Mossy Rock, or a Frozen Rock into its respective evolved forms.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Ranger, all of Eevee's evolved forms up to the third generation can be captured; however, Eevee is completely unobtainable. This was changed in Pok\u00e9mon Ranger: Shadows of Almia.\nDespite the fact that May, Gary, and Sakura each owned an Eevee that went on to evolve, Eevee was never seen evolving onscreen in Pok\u00e9mon the Series until Last Call \u2014 First Round!, when Ursula evolved her two Eevee into Flareon and Vaporeon during a Contest appeal, over thirteen years into the series.\nAs a species, Eevee has appeared in the teams of the most main characters in Pok\u00e9mon the Series, with May, Serena, and Lana each owning one.\nThis also makes Eevee the only Pok\u00e9mon species in the series to have been owned by more than two different main characters.\nEevee has more signature moves than any other Pok\u00e9mon, with a total of eleven.\nEevee is the only pre-existing Pok\u00e9mon to receive a gender difference after Generation IV.\nAll of Eevee's Evolutions up to Sylveon were of types that had been considered special before Generation IV. The only special move type not included is the Dragon type.\nEevee Day is celebrated since 2018 on November 21 (11/21), which is goroawase for \"i-i-bu-i\", Eevee's Japanese name. It is certified by the Japan Anniversary Association.[6]\nOrigin\nIn the 2018 artbook EVs, Motofumi Fujiwara revealed that the idea for Eevee came from Satoshi Tajiri's request to have a Pok\u00e9mon that evolves into multiple types. Fujiwara himself designed Eevee as a \"blank slate\" for its varied Evolutions; as such, while Eevee has traits of foxes, dogs, and cats, it is not based on any specific animal. Fujiwara also envisioned Eevee as a creature that could exist \"in people's memories\"; namely, vague memories of seeing a cat or dog-like creature that players might have experienced in their childhood.[4][7]\n\nName origin\nEevee and Eievui are pronunciations of E-V, the first two letters in the word Evolution.[4]\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30a4\u30fc\u30d6\u30a4 Eievui\n\nFrom the first two letters of evolution\n\n\n French\n\n\u00c9voli\n\nFrom \u00e9volution and -li, the suffix for all French Eeveelutions\n\n\n Spanish\n\nEevee\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nEvoli\n\nFrom Evolution\n\n\n Italian\n\nEevee\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc774\ube0c\uc774 Eevee\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u4f0a\u5e03 Y\u012bb\u00f9\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u4f0a\u5e03 Y\u012bbou*\u4f0a\u8c9d Y\u012bbui*\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d0\u05d9\u05d1\u05d9 Eevee\u05d0\u05d9\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9 Eevee\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0908\u0935\u0940 Eevee\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0418\u0432\u0438 Ivi\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e27\u0e38\u0e22 Iwui\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Turkish\n\nEvri\n\nFrom evrim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\n\nGary's Eevee\nMay's Eevee\nSakura's Eevee\nSerena's Eevee\nSandy\nGladion's Eevee\nChloe's Eevee\nVee\nCoconut's Eevee\nLu\nEspeon (UNITE)\nUmbreon (UNITE)\nLeafeon (UNITE)\nGlaceon (UNITE)\nSylveon (UNITE)\nPartner Pok\u00e9mon (Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!)\nFirst partner Pok\u00e9mon\nPartner Pok\u00e9mon (Mystery Dungeon)\nGigantamax\nList of Pok\u00e9mon with form differences\n\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 Gigantamax Eevee | Official Website | Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield\n\n\u2191 Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Eevee! | Experience the World of Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\u2191 4.0 4.1 4.2 (2018) EVs.
