It has a red-brown pelt with a cream-colored underbelly. It has brown eyes, large, pointed ears with dark brown insides, and a triangular dark brown nose. Its paws are slightly darker than the rest of its pelt and have light brown paw pads. On top of its head are three curled locks of orange fur with bangs, and it has orange tails with curled tips. It is most commonly seen with six tails. However, Vulpix is born with only a white tail that splits as Vulpix grows. The tails grow hot as Vulpix approaches evolution.\nVulpix can manipulate fire to such precision as to create floating wisps of flame. These wisps are sometimes mistaken for ghosts by humans, but Vulpix uses them to assist in catching prey. Inside its body is a flame that never goes out. When the temperature outside increases, it will expel flames from its mouth to prevent its body from overheating. Vulpix performs this even when sleeping, as mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex.[1] Vulpix is known to feign injury to escape from opponents too powerful for it to defeat. Vulpix is most commonly found in grassy plains.\n\nForms\n In Alola, Keokeo are as white as snow\nVulpix has a regional form: Alolan Vulpix.\nIn the Alola region, Vulpix has adapted to snowy mountain peaks and developed a snowy white pelt. It has pale blue paws, blue eyes, and dark blue inside its ears. Its snout is more pronounced and pointed than that of non-Alolan Vulpix. The locks of hair on its head and its six tails are curlier and have a wispy appearance.\nAlolan Vulpix is believed to have arrived in the region at the same time as humans but moved to the snow-capped mountain to avoid other Pok\u00e9mon. It can be found in small packs, called skulks, that are led and protected by Ninetales. Alolan Vulpix can expel breath as cold as \u221258\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221250\u00a0\u00b0C), which is capable of freezing anything. While it is not suited to warmer environments, its tail can produce ice to lower the surrounding temperature if needed. An old, local name for this Pok\u00e9mon is \"Keokeo\", referring to its white pelt. Weavile is a natural predator of Alolan Vulpix. They can also be found in the Polar Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated.\n\nEvolution\nVulpix evolves into Ninetales.\nAlolan Vulpix evolves into Alolan Ninetales.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nVulpix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nVulpix\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nNinetales\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlolan Vulpix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nVulpixAlolan Form\u00a0Ice\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nNinetalesAlolan Form\u00a0Ice\u00a0\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #037\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nAt the time of birth, it has just one tail.

Both are Generation I Pok\u00e9mon that evolve once via a Fire Stone. Vulpix is exclusive to Pok\u00e9mon Green, international Blue, Silver, LeafGreen, and SoulSilver while Growlithe is to Red, Blue (Japan), Gold, FireRed, and HeartGold. Growlithe has a 75% chance of being male while Vulpix has a 75% of being female, they are both in the Field Egg Group, can have Flash Fire as their Ability, and are yellow when Shiny from Generation III on. Furthermore, both are based primarily on canine-like creatures of Japanese folklore: Vulpix from the kitsune, Growlithe from the shisa. Additionally, both have received regional forms.\nAlolan Vulpix can be seen as a parallel to Alolan Sandshrew. Both were initially introduced in Generation I and got Alolan Forms in Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon. Both Pok\u00e9mon are Ice-types, with Vulpix being exclusive to Sun and Sandshrew being exclusive to Moon. Furthermore, both Pok\u00e9mon evolve when exposed to an Ice Stone.\nVulpix is the only Pok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 299.\nVulpix has the lowest base HP of all Fire-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nAlolan Vulpix is the only unevolved Pok\u00e9mon to have a Pok\u00e9mon VSTAR card.\nVulpix's National Pok\u00e9dex number and Kitakami Pok\u00e9dex number are identical: 0037 for the former, and 37 for the latter.\nOrigin\nVulpix may be based on a red fox and the \u72d0 kitsune of Japanese legend, which are said to have many tails, extremely long lifespans, and supernatural powers such as the ability to breathe fire. After reaching an advanced age, kitsune take on spirit forms, which may explain why Vulpix can learn various Ghost-type and Psychic-type moves.\nAlolan Vulpix may be based on an Arctic fox, which grows a white coat of fur in the winter to camouflage in the snow.\n\nName origin\nVulpix may be a combination of vulpes (Latin for fox) and six. It may also involve Vulcan, the Roman god of fire.\nIts Alolan name, Keokeo, may be derived from ke\u02bboke\u02bbo (Hawaiian for white).\nRokon may be a combination of \u516d roku (six), \u3053\u3093 kon (onomatopoetic sound of a fox's cry), and \u711c\u7089 konro (gas stove). It may also involve \u6068 kon (grudge; from the curse its evolution may cast on its foes).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30ed\u30b3\u30f3 Rokon\n\nFrom \u516d roku, \u3053\u3093 kon, \u711c\u7089 konro, and possibly \u6068 kon\n\n\n French\n\nGoupix\n\nFrom goupil and six\n\n\n Spanish\n\nVulpix\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nVulpix\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Italian\n\nVulpix\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc2dd\uc2a4\ud14c\uc77c Sixtail\n\nFrom six and tail\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u516d\u5c3e Li\u00f9w\u011bi\n\nFrom \u516d li\u00f9 and \u5c3e w\u011bi\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u516d\u5c3e Luhkm\u00e9ih\n\nFrom \u516d luhk and \u5c3e m\u00e9ih\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0935\u0932\u092a\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 Vulpix\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nVulpiksas\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0412\u0430\u043b\u043f\u0438\u043a\u0441 Valpiks\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e42\u0e23\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e19 Rokhon\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeokeo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b1\u30aa\u30b1\u30aa Ke\u02bboke\u02bbo\n\nFrom ke\u02bboke\u02bbo (Hawaiian for white)\n\n\n French\n\nKe'oke'o\n\nSame as Japanese name\n\n\n Spanish\n\nKeo-Keo\n\nSame as Japanese name\n\n\n German\n\nKe'oke'o\n\nSame as Japanese name\n\n\n Italian\n\nKe'oke'o\n\nSame as Japanese name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ucf00\uc624\ucf00\uc624 Ke\u02bboke\u02bbo\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u51f1\u6b50\u51f1\u6b50 / \u51ef\u6b27\u51ef\u6b27 K\u01cei'\u014duk\u01cei'\u014du\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u51f1\u6b50\u51f1\u6b50 H\u00f3i'\u0101uh\u00f3i'\u0101u\n\nMandarin-based transcription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nBrock's Vulpix\nSnowy\nEnta's Vulpix\nAlolan Ninetales (UNITE)\nPartner Pok\u00e9mon (Mystery Dungeon)\nRegional form\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex entry: \"Inside Vulpix's body burns a flame that never goes out.
