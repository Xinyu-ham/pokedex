It has large eyes and pink lips that can also act as suction cups for rocks. Its skin is very thin, but flexible and difficult to puncture. There is a black and white swirl on its abdomen, which is actually its internal organs showing through its semitransparent skin. The swirl is clearer following a meal and will have a white tinge if the Pok\u00e9mon is affected by disease. The direction of the belly spiral differs by area; the equator is thought to have an effect on it.\nPoliwag has newly developed legs that are poor at walking and no arms. It has a long, thin tail surrounded by a light-blue, semitransparent fin. Its tail makes it a powerful swimmer. It loves to waddle on land despite the dangers. However, it will quickly return back into the water should it see danger. It cannot walk on land well unless trained everyday.\nBecause of its ineptitude on land, Poliwag is more likely to be found swimming in small freshwater ponds and lakes. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Stun Spore Detour, Poliwag is shown feeding on salveyo weed, which can only be found on clear lake bottoms.\n\nEvolution\nPoliwag evolves into Poliwhirl, which evolves into either Poliwrath or Politoed.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nPoliwag\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPoliwhirl\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2197\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nPoliwrath\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2198\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nPolitoed\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: A Poliwag appears on the Blue Table, and earns the player points when it is hit.\nPok\u00e9mon Super Mystery Dungeon: A Poliwag, along with three Poliwrath, appear as the boss of Poliwrath River.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #060\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nIts newly grown legs prevent it from running.

The Ruby and Sapphire Pok\u00e9dex entry for Poliwhirl states that Poliwhirl's skin is covered in oily fluid\u2014if the same applies to Poliwag, it might be a case similar to the common bilberry: the berry itself is black but covered in a wax-like coating that makes it look blue.\nIn The Official Pok\u00e9mon Handbook, published by Scholastic, the back cover says \"Did you know that the swirls on Poliwhirl's stomach changes direction when it evolves into Poliwag?\" However, Poliwhirl evolves from, not into, Poliwag.\nGeneration V changed Poliwag's base Experience yield from 77 to 60, making it the only Pok\u00e9mon whose base Experience yield is the same as its National Dex number.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, Poliwag holds the record as the Pok\u00e9mon who takes the least amount of time to evolve twice, taking only one chapter. It shares this with Caterpie and Togepi.\nPoliwag shares its species name with Poliwhirl, Poliwrath, and Tympole. They are all known as the Tadpole Pok\u00e9mon.\nPrior to Generation VI, Poliwag and Ditto had the same cry.\nA prototype design of Poliwag was shown on Game Freak's official Japanese website in 1997.\nThe Red and Blue Pokedex entries state Poliwag are born without legs. However with the addition of Pok\u00e9mon Eggs in the next generation, Poliwag are shown to be born with legs.\nOrigin\nPoliwag is based on a tadpole. The spiral pattern on its belly is supposed to represent how the intestines of tadpoles are sometimes seen through their transparent skin.[2] Poliwag's Pok\u00e9mon Silver Pok\u00e9dex entry saying that the direction of its belly spiral differs by area relative the equator may allude to the coriolis effect.\n\nName origin\nPoliwag may be derived from polliwog (outdated term for tadpole), which is formed from Middle English words pol (head) and wiglen (to wiggle). It may also involve wag (to swing from side to side).\nNyoromo may be a combination of \u30cb\u30e7\u30ed\u30cb\u30e7\u30ed nyoronyoro (onomatopoeia for wriggling) and \u5b50\u4f9b kodomo (child).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30cb\u30e7\u30ed\u30e2 Nyoromo\n\nFrom \u30cb\u30e7\u30ed\u30cb\u30e7\u30ed nyoronyoro and \u5b50\u4f9b kodomo\n\n\n French\n\nPtitard\n\nFrom petit and t\u00eatard\n\n\n Spanish\n\nPoliwag\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nQuapsel\n\nFrom Kaulquappe\n\n\n Italian\n\nPoliwag\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ubc1c\ucc59\uc774 Balchengi\n\nFrom \ubc1c bal and \uc62c\ucc59\uc774 olchaeng-i\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u868a\u9999\u874c\u86aa W\u00e9nxi\u0101ngk\u0113d\u01d2u\n\nFrom \u868a\u9999 w\u00e9nxi\u0101ng and \u874c\u86aa k\u0113d\u01d2u\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u868a\u9999\u874c\u86aa M\u0101nh\u0113ungf\u014dd\u00e1u\n\nFrom \u868a\u9999 m\u0101nh\u0113ung and \u874c\u86aa f\u014dd\u00e1u\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092c\u0948\u0902\u0917\u091a\u093f\u092c\u093f Bangchibi\n\nFrom \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0917/\u092c\u0947\u0901\u0917 bang and \u3061\u3073 chibi\n\n\n Icelandic\n\nFj\u00f6lli*\n\nSimilar to the English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nPolivagas\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0433 Polivag\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e40\u0e19\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e42\u0e23\u0e42\u0e21\u0e30 Niaoromo\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nMisty's Poliwag\nPoli\nPolibo\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Interview with Satoshi Tajiri on Game Center CX (Japanese TV) 2004\n\n\u2191 TIME - The Ultimate Game Freak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0059: Arcanine\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0061: Poliwhirl\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Poliwag_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128838\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monWater-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Slow experience groupBlue-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 07 Pok\u00e9monWater 1 group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon with branched EvolutionsPok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kitakami Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 300Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became both Special Attack and Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 18 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 16:28.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
