It is the final form of Charmander.\nCharizard has three forms: Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Gigantamax Charizard. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard X using the Charizardite X and Mega Charizard Y using the Charizardite Y, and can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Charizard if it has the Gigantamax Factor.\nCharizard is the game mascot of Pok\u00e9mon Red and its remake Pok\u00e9mon FireRed, appearing on the boxart of both games.\nAlong with Pikachu, Talonflame, and Decidueye, Charizard is one of the four partner Pok\u00e9mon available through the Unite Licenses in Pok\u00e9mon UNITE as of version 1.12.1.2.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biology\n\n1.1 Forms\n1.2 Evolution\n\n\n2 Game data\n\n2.1 NPC appearances\n2.2 Pok\u00e9dex entries\n2.3 Game locations\n\n2.3.1 In side games\n2.3.2 In events\n\n2.3.2.1 Wild Area News\n2.3.2.2 Pok\u00e9 Portal News\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Held items\n2.5 Stats\n\n2.5.1 Base stats\n\n2.5.1.1 Charizard\n2.5.1.2 Mega Charizard X\n2.5.1.3 Mega Charizard Y\n\n\n2.5.2 Pok\u00e9athlon stats\n\n\n2.6 Type effectiveness\n\n2.6.1 Charizard and Mega Charizard Y\n2.6.2 Mega Charizard X\n\n\n2.7 Learnset\n\n2.7.1 By leveling up\n2.7.2 By TM\n2.7.3 By breeding\n2.7.4 By a prior Evolution\n2.7.5 Animated series-only moves\n\n\n2.8 Side game data\n\n2.8.1 Charizard\n2.8.2 Mega Charizard X\n2.8.3 Mega Charizard Y\n\n\n2.9 Form data\n\n2.9.1 Mega Evolution\n2.9.2 Gigantamax\n\n\n2.10 Evolution data\n2.11 Sprites\n\n2.11.1 Other sprites\n\n\n\n\n3 In animation\n\n3.1 Main series\n\n3.1.1 Major appearances\n\n3.1.1.1 Ash's Charizard\n3.1.1.2 Charla\n3.1.1.3 Team A.C.T.\n3.1.1.4 Alain's Charizard\n3.1.1.5 Trevor's Charizard\n3.1.1.6 Kiawe's Charizard\n3.1.1.7 Leon's Charizard\n3.1.1.8 Friede's Charizard\n3.1.1.9 Other\n\n\n3.1.2 Minor appearances\n3.1.3 Pok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n3.2 Pok\u00e9mon Origins\n\n3.2.1 Red's Charizard\n3.2.2 Other\n\n\n3.3 Pok\u00e9mon Generations\n3.4 Pok\u00e9mon: Twilight Wings\n\n3.4.1 Leon's Charizard\n\n\n3.5 POK\u00c9TOON\n3.6 Pok\u00e9mon Evolutions\n\n3.6.1 Red's Charizard\n\n3.6.1.1 Leon's Charizard\n\n\n\n\n3.7 GOTCHA!\n\n3.7.1 Red's Charizard\n3.7.2 Leon's Charizard\n\n\n\n\n4 In the manga\n\n4.1 Pok\u00e9mon Adventures\n\n4.1.1 Major appearances\n\n4.1.1.1 Blue's Charizard\n4.1.1.2 Salam\u00e8\n4.1.1.3 Kiawe's Charizard\n4.1.1.4 Leon's Charizard\n\n\n4.1.2 Minor appearances\n\n\n4.2 Pok\u00e9mon Pocket Monsters\n4.3 Pok\u00e9mon Ruby-Sapphire\n4.4 The Electric Tale of Pikachu\n4.5 Pok\u00e9mon Zensho\n4.6 Movie adaptations\n4.7 Pok\u00e9mon: Yeah!

It is primarily orange with a cream underside from the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its rectangular head. Two fangs are visible in its upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the top of the third joint of each wing. A single wing finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard's arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. In Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green, Charizard is seemingly shown holding a fireball, implying that it's capable of manipulating its flames using its hands; this is seen in media where it uses Fire Punch. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame, which can intensify to a blue flame if Charizard is irritated.\nCharizard typically inhabits mountains and valleys, such as the Charicific Valley in Johto. However, Charizard can also live in volcanoes, forming packs with other members of its family, including Charmander. In Pok\u00e9mon Snap, it's shown that Charizard are fully capable of living inside lava within volcanic craters.\nCharizard flies in search of powerful opponents to battle, and its fire will burn hotter as it gains experience. Its fiery breath can melt boulders and massive glaciers and has been known to cause forest fires accidentally. Though its fiery breath is hot, it never turns it on any opponent weaker than itself. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Charizard's Burning Ambitions showed that only a weak Charizard would show off its power. The side story episode Those Darn Electabuzz! showed that Charizard can swim underwater, with Pok\u00e9mon Origins further showing that the flame on the tip of the tail can still keep burning underwater. Charizard's wings can carry it to an altitude of 4,600 feet (1,400 meters), but the An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS notes that its droppings were found on Mt. Fuji, implying it could fly thrice as high. In Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, as well as media like the animated series, Charizard is known to sleep in an incredibly relaxed position, [1] as it is very confident in its power. Some Charizard are occasionally seen sleeping flat on their backs, which is potentially a sign that those Charizard are especially strong.\nEven though Charizard originally couldn't learn the move Fly, Trainers have been shown riding Charizard in official artwork dating back to the 1997 Carddass Trading Cards. Ash himself was shown riding his Charizard already in the second season of the original series of Pok\u00e9mon the Series. Eventually, in Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, Charizard became able to learn Fly and has since been frequently depicted as a Pok\u00e9mon able to carry people on its back to fly them to distant areas. In Alola, Charizard is a Ride Pok\u00e9mon called Charizard Glide, being used by the natives to fly around the region or make deliveries.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharizard Glide\n\n\n\n\nForms\n Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y.\nCharizard has three alternate forms: Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and Gigantamax Charizard.\nBoth of Charizard's Mega Evolutions feature a shorter snout, white, vertical slit pupils, and a bright underside reaching the lower jaw.\n\nMega Charizard X\nAs Mega Charizard X, its body and legs are more physically fit, though its arms remain thin. Its skin turns black with a sky-blue underside and soles. Two spikes with blue tips curve upward from the front and back of each shoulder, while the tips of its horns sharpen, turn blue, and curve slightly upward. Its brow and claws are larger, and its eyes are now red. It has two small, fin-like spikes under each horn and two more down its lower neck. The finger disappears from the wing membrane, and the lower edges are divided into large, rounded points. The third joint of each wing-arm is adorned with a claw-like spike. Mega Charizard X breathes blue flames out the sides of its mouth, and the flame on its tail now burns blue consistently. It is said that its new power turns it black and creates more intense flames.\n\nMega Charizard Y\nAs Mega Charizard Y, it becomes sleeker in appearance but retains its normal coloration. It has three pointed horns on the back of its head, the middle of which is longer. Its snout has larger fangs and a ridge on the nose. Its neck is shorter, but its torso is thinner and longer. It features longer digitigrade feet. Its hands are less developed, with extremely shortened fingers that are no longer separated from each other. Small wings develop on its wrists, while the ones on its back become larger, lose the wing finger passing through their membrane and end up with ragged edges. The back of its tail has a large spike at the base and three smaller ones near the tip, which now burns with a longer flame. Mega Charizard Y is said to have incredible flying prowess that is greater than that of a jet fighter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMega Charizard X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMega Charizard Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGigantamax\n Gigantamax Charizard's wingless body\nAs Gigantamax Charizard, it becomes larger and more physically fit. The lower part of its body glows white, with several yellow diamonds on the lower belly. There are also diamond-shaped spots located on the front legs. The claws located on its hands and feet become longer and sharper. The feet become longer and digitigrade, retaining small glowing soles under the forefeet. The sclerae of the eyes become yellow. The glow of a flame can be seen in the mouth, and the teeth grow, with the lower front teeth and three teeth in the middle now protruding when the mouth is closed. The flame on the tail extends out and has three red clouds surrounding it, like the clouds most other Gigantamax Pok\u00e9mon have. Two flames sprout from its horns, and its wings are transformed into literal flame wings extending to the shoulder blade. These colossal flamed wings were created from the energy of Gigantamaxing and are hotter than magma; Gigantamax Charizard uses these flames to burn its opponents.[2] The flames within Gigantamax Charizard burn hotter than 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit (2,000 degrees Celsius), and increase in temperature when it roars.\nGigantamax Charizard is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Wildfire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGigantamax Charizard\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nCharizard evolves from Charmeleon and is the final form of Charmander.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nCharmander\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nCharmeleon\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nCharizard\u00a0Fire\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Charizard is a member of Team A.C.T..\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #006\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nSpits fire that is hot enough to melt boulders.

This was because of its powerful attack, Fire Spin, and useful Pok\u00e9mon Power, Energy Burn, which allowed it to convert any Energy attached to it to Fire Energy. Fire Spin needed four Fire Energy and could deal 100 damage, knocking out the majority of Pok\u00e9mon cards. In addition, it had the highest HP then, at 120. Individual Charizard cards were sold up to as much as $150. First edition cards of this dwarfed this price at one point breaking the $1000 US price point.

Both Pok\u00e9mon change their typing in their X Mega Evolutions while they remain the same type in their Y Mega Evolutions. Both X Mega Evolutions are physically oriented while their Y Mega Evolutions are specially oriented.\nCharizard is the first of the evolved first partner Pok\u00e9mon to received a Gigantamax form and the only introduced in the base game of Sword and Shield.\nPrior to Generation VI, Charizard and Rhyhorn shared the same cry.

However, outside of Japan, Mewtwo is the first to appear.\nCharizard is the only Pok\u00e9mon in the Super Smash Bros. series that transitioned from a Pok\u00e9 Ball Pok\u00e9mon to a playable character.\nCharizard and Johtonian Typhlosion, along with their respective evolutionary lines, have exactly the same base stats in the same distribution.\nMega Charizard Y has the highest base Special Attack stat of all Fire-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nCharizard is the only Pok\u00e9mon not in the Alola Pok\u00e9dex to be a Ride Pok\u00e9mon in Sun and Moon (where it is unobtainable via normal gameplay) and Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.\nCharizard is the only non-Galar first partner Pok\u00e9mon to be in the Galar Pok\u00e9dex in the base game of Sword and Shield.\nCharizard is the most common Pok\u00e9mon found amongst Champions, being used by four of them.\nBecause of its beauty and elegance, Driftveil Drawbridge is also referred to as Charizard Bridge.\nCharizard is character designer Atsuko Nishida's favorite Pok\u00e9mon.[3]\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon of the Year poll held by The Pok\u00e9mon Company in 2020, Charizard was voted the most popular Generation I Pok\u00e9mon, receiving 93,968 votes. It was also the fourth-most popular Pok\u00e9mon overall.\nThe current design of a Shiny Charizard was first seen in an official art from 2001, between the releases of Pok\u00e9mon Crystal and Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire.\nPok\u00e9mon the Series: Diamond and Pearl is the only series of either of the Pok\u00e9mon TV shows to not feature a Charizard in any capacity.\nIn Generation IX, Charizard is unable to learn both Metal Claw and False Swipe via TM, while its pre-evolutions can learn False Swipe and Charmander can learn Metal Claw.\nCharizard is the first Pok\u00e9mon species in the Pok\u00e9mon animated TV shows to use all major battle gimmicks as of Generation IX, doing so by Mega Evolving in Mega Evolution Special I, using a Z-Move in Run, Heroes, Run!, Gigantamaxing in Flash of the Titans!, and Terastallizing in Fly! Wattrel!!.\nMerchandise\n Charizard in Pok\u00e9mon Battle Chess\nCharizard appears in Pok\u00e9mon Battle Chess. It behaves like the bishop piece in chess, but can also move one square backwards.\nCharizard was the focus of a Pok\u00e9mon Center promotion in April 2010.\nCultural impact\nCharizard was the inspiration for the naming of Chilicola charizard, a species of stem-nesting bees. The discoverer, Spencer K. Monckton, was inspired to name the species after Charizard thanks to its mountainous habitat and the orange coloration found in the first specimen he observed.[4][5]\nConcept and development\nCharizard, its pre-evolved forms, and Mega Charizard X were designed by Atsuko Nishida.[6][7]\n\nOrigin\nCharizard may be based on European dragons, which are heavily associated with the element of fire in European folklore; this draconic appearance would later be reflected in the Fire/Dragon typing of Mega Charizard X. Like its pre-evolved forms, it may also take inspiration from lizards, dinosaurs, and the mythical salamander. Its English and Japanese nomenclature may be a reference to how Western dragons are heavily inspired by lizards and other reptiles.\n\nName origin\nCharizard may be a combination of char (to burn) and lizard.\nLizardon may be a combination of lizard and either dragon or -don (common suffix in dinosaur names derived from the Ancient Greek word for tooth).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30ea\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9\u30f3 Lizardon\n\nFrom lizard, dragon, and -don\n\n\n French\n\nDracaufeu\n\nFrom draco and Au feu!\n\n\n Spanish\n\nCharizard\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nGlurak\n\nFrom Glut, Drache, and possibly Rakete\n\n\n Italian\n\nCharizard\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub9ac\uc790\ubabd Rizamon\n\nFrom lizard and monster\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5674\u706b\u9f8d / \u55b7\u706b\u9f99 P\u0113nhu\u01d2l\u00f3ng\n\nFrom \u5674\u706b / \u55b7\u706b p\u0113nhu\u01d2 and \u9f8d / \u9f99 l\u00f3ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5674\u706b\u9f8d P\u0101nf\u00f3l\u00f9hng\n\nFrom \u5674\u706b panf\u00f3 and \u9f8d l\u00f9hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Arabic\n\n\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0632\u0627\u0631\u062f Charizard\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Bulgarian\n\n\u0427\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0440\u0434 Charizard\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Greek\n\n\u03a4\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03b6\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4 Ts\u00e1rizart\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05e6'\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d6\u05d0\u05e8\u05d3 Charizard\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u091a\u093e\u0930\u093f\u091c\u093c\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0921 Charizard\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Indonesian\n\nCharizardKarizar*\n\nSame as English nameFrom the English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\n\u017davizardas\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0427\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0440\u0434 Charizard\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e25\u0e34\u0e0b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e19 Lisadon\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\n\nAsh's Charizard\nKiawe's Charizard\nZippo\nCharla\nAlain's Charizard\nTrevor's Charizard\nLeon's Charizard\nFriede's Charizard\nSatoshi's Charizard (Zensho)\nBlue's Charizard\nSalam\u00e8\nRed's Charizard\nGreen's Charizard\nCharizard (Pokk\u00e9n)\nTeam A.C.T.\nCharizard (Super Smash Bros.)\nPok\u00e9mon Trainer (Super Smash Bros.)\nCharizard (UNITE)\nFirst partner Pok\u00e9mon\nMega Evolution\nGigantamax\n\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 Gigantamax Charizard | Official Website | Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield\n\n\u2191 Creator Profile: The Creators of Pikachu - Pok\u00e9mon.com (archived)\n\n\u2191 A revision of Chilicola (Heteroediscelis), a subgenus of xeromelissine bees (Hymenoptera, Colletidae) endemic to Chile: taxonomy, phylogeny, and biogeography, with descriptions of eight new species\n\n\u2191 (June 1, 2016). \"One of 8 new endemic polyester bees from Chile bears the name of a draconic Pokemon.\" EurekAlert!.
