It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. Small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb that conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also provides it with energy through photosynthesis and from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.\nFirst partner Pok\u00e9mon are raised by Breeders to be distributed to new Trainers.[1] Having been raised by humans from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pok\u00e9mon. It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment.[2] Bulbasaur have demonstrated a nurturing instinct towards younger, weaker Pok\u00e9mon, one individual even using its vines to pick up a crying Pok\u00e9mon, gently rocking it back and forth through the air while singing a \"Bulba-by\".[3] Its vines are long and strong enough to allow Bulbasaur to grab the branches of trees and pull itself up to reach berries.[4] Bulbasaur can survive for days without even eating a single morsel. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex, Bulbasaur is known to sleep in sunny spots.\nIt is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region. However, due to Bulbasaur's status as first partner Pok\u00e9mon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. A Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation.[5] Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to evolve into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.\n\n\nEvolution\nBulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur, which evolves into Venusaur.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nBulbasaur\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nIvysaur\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nVenusaur\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #001\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nA strange seed was planted on its back at birth.

Though initially wary of Ash, the two eventually warmed up to one another, and Bulbasaur challenged him to a battle. Using Pikachu, Ash won the battle, and Bulbasaur was caught. Unlike Charmander and Squirtle, which were caught in the two episodes following that of Bulbasaur, Bulbasaur remained in Ash's party for most of his journey through Johto until Bulbasaur... the Ambassador!, when Ash sent him to Professor Oak's lab to work as an ambassador between otherwise argumentative groups of Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nMay's Bulbasaur\nMuch later on, while Ash was traveling in the Hoenn region, May caught her own Bulbasaur after being separated from the group in Grass Hysteria!. She remained with her throughout the rest of her journey in Hoenn, helping her to win the Purika Contest and place Top 8 in the regional Grand Festival. When she traveled to Kanto to continue her journey with Ash in The Right Place and the Right Mime, May, too, left her Bulbasaur at Professor Oak's Laboratory to learn from Ash's while she, Ash, Max, and Brock traveled throughout the Kanto region. May retrieved her during her travels in Johto, where she evolved all the way into a Venusaur.\n\nShauna's Bulbasaur\nShauna's first partner Pok\u00e9mon is a Bulbasaur she received from Professor Sycamore. It first appeared in Summer of Discovery!, and it was revealed to have evolved into Ivysaur by Tag Team Battle Inspiration!\n\nOther\nIn Mewtwo Strikes Back, a Bulbasaur was cloned from Ash's own Bulbasaur. The cloned Bulbasaur participated in the battle between the original Pok\u00e9mon and the cloned Pok\u00e9mon. Bulbasaur reappeared in Mewtwo Returns.\nIn The Mystery Menace, a Bulbasaur was abandoned by the Mayor of Trovitopolis during his childhood when it wouldn't evolve into Ivysaur. Since then, it grew to a very large size in the sewers. Aided by Misty and Tracey, Ash found the abandoned Bulbasaur while searching for his own, which had been taken by the giant Bulbasaur.

Melee and Brawl\nBulbasaur appears as a random trophy.\n\nMelee trophy information\n\"Bulbasaur is a cute Pok\u00e9mon born with a large seed firmly affixed to its back; the seed grows in size as the Pok\u00e9mon does. Along with Squirtle and Charmander, Bulbasaur is one of the three Pok\u00e9mon available at the beginning of Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue. It evolves into Ivysaur.\"\n\nBrawl trophy information\n\"A Seed Pok\u00e9mon. From birth, Bulbasaur carries a large plant seed on its back. It uses the nutrients from the seed to grow bigger and bigger. Extended exposure to the sun will cause its body and seed to grow in size. Some say that once, when the seed was much lighter, Bulbasaur was able to get around on two legs. Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur.\"\n\nPOK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu\nMultiple Bulbasaur appeared in POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu. After Detective Pikachu was injured in the garden of giant Torterra, they and a group of Morelull escorted Tim, Lucy, and Pikachu to Mewtwo, who healed it.\n\nCelestial\nMultiple Bulbasaur appeared in the music video for Celestial.\n\n\nTrivia\nIn the Japanese Pok\u00e9mon Red, Green, and Blue, the international Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, and the Japanese Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen, Professor Oak classifies Bulbasaur as the \"plant Pok\u00e9mon\" (Japanese: \u3057\u3087\u304f\u3076\u3064\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3) when the player is about to choose it as their first partner Pok\u00e9mon, using the term while referring to its type. In the English versions of Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen, he calls it the \"grass Pok\u00e9mon\".\nThis also occurs in the first episode of Pok\u00e9mon Origins.\nBulbasaur's evolutionary line is the only first partner Pok\u00e9mon family to have the Poison-type.\nBulbasaur's evolutionary line is also the only first partner line to have each member appear at least once in the Super Smash Bros. series.\nBulbasaur shares its category with its evolved forms and Sunkern. They are all known as the Seed Pok\u00e9mon.\nBulbasaur's number in the National Pok\u00e9dex and the Fiore Browser are the same: 001.\nDue to the censor that prevents Pok\u00e9mon with offensive nicknames being traded on the GTS, a Bulbasaur with an English name couldn't be traded on the GTS without a nickname in Pok\u00e9mon Black and White.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver, Bulbasaur is programmed to be able to learn Charm through breeding, but no other Pok\u00e9mon in the Grass or Monster Groups can legitimately learn it to pass down as an Egg Move in those games. In Generation III and IV, Bulbasaur can inherit the move from Shroomish by chain breeding. In Generation V onwards, Bulbasaur can inherit the move directly from Cottonee.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon, Bulbasaur could learn Vine Whip at level 7 instead of Leech Seed. This oversight was later fixed in Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.\nAccording to the Trainer Race quiz minigame from Pok\u00e9ROM, the word \"strong\" is a good adjective to describe Bulbasaur.\nCultural impact\n $1 coins from Niue\nNiue released a one-dollar coin featuring Bulbasaur as part of a commemorative promotion for the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, with Bulbasaur on one side and the nation's coat of arms on the other.\nWhile Bulbasaur is not considered to be part of the inspiration for the naming of Bulbasaurus, a genus of dicynodonts, it has been noted that the similarities \"may not be entirely coincidental\".[6]\nOrigin\nBulbasaur is based on a frog.[7][8] In particular, its short legs, stout appearance, and ear-like protrusions on its head make it resemble horned frogs. According to Ken Sugimori and Atsuko Nishida, the latter designed Bulbasaur working backward from Venusaur, meaning Bulbasaur was the last of its evolutionary line to have been designed and was also directly based on Venusaur.[8] The bulb on its back resembles a lily or onion.\n\nName origin\nBulbasaur is a combination of bulb[9][10][11] (a rounded underground storage organ present in some plants) and dinosaur[11] or -saurus[10] (common suffix used in the names of extinct reptilian creatures, derived from the Ancient Greek word for lizard). The name also sounds similar to the word bulbous.\nFushigidane may be a combination of \u4e0d\u601d\u8b70 fushigi (strange; mysterious) and \u7a2e tane (seed), as well as a pun of the phrase \u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u3060\u306d Fushigi da ne?
