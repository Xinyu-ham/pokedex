There is a fluffy, curled tuft of fur on its head, which is described as perfectly heavenly. It has long, rabbit-like ears with black insides and a slightly lighter color at the tips. Its large, blue eyes are covered in a layer of tears that quickly washes away any debris. It is covered in pink fur with a white belly. This fine layer of fur is so soft that those who touch it, including other Wigglytuff, will not want to stop. As a result, Wigglytuff is a highly sought-after Pok\u00e9mon because of its bouncy body and fur. It sheds seasonally, and people gather the fur to spin into yarn. It is proud of its fine and delicate fur.\nIts body is soft and rubbery, allowing it to inflate by inhaling. Wigglytuff can inflate itself up to 20 times larger, though it has no limits to how far it can inflate in total. While it is inflated, it can move by bouncing or floating. It competes with other Wigglytuff to see which one can inflate itself the most. Should it be caught in a bad mood, Wigglytuff will inflate itself to an enormous size to scare away its opponent. Being the result of evolution via Evolution stone, Wigglytuff is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in vivid green plains and grassy fields. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Wigglytuff is known to stroke its belly while sleeping, possibly to feel its soft fur[1].\n\n\nEvolution\nWigglytuff evolves from Jigglypuff and is the final form of Igglybuff.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nIgglybuff\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nJigglypuff\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nWigglytuff\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Wigglytuff sells Friend Areas in Pok\u00e9mon Square.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness and Explorers of Sky: Wigglytuff is the head of the main guild in Treasure Town. His personality tends to be erratic, but he cares about all his friends in the guild, especially his close partner Chatot. He also has a love (some would say obsession) of Perfect Apples, and is basically all he eats. He can often be seen bouncing one off his head during dinner. He is described as peculiar and weird in the game, although he is exceptionally strong, defeating the whole of Team Skull and Kabutops and the Omastar Brothers, as well as numerous others, with ease. Chatot warns not to annoy or disrespect Wigglytuff, as he is liable to explode with anger.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #040\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nThe body is soft and rubbery.

It is a melee supporter that starts as Jigglypuff, which evolves into Wigglytuff at level 4.\n\n\nTrivia\nWigglytuff and its pre-evolved forms share their category name with Qwilfish and Drifloon. They are all known as the Balloon Pok\u00e9mon.\nWigglytuff has the highest base HP stat of all Fairy-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nIn its earlier appearances, Wigglytuff's white stomach did not always extend above its mouth; however, it always does this in modern appearances.\nOrigin\nWigglytuff appears to be based on a balloon due to its inflatable body. Its soft fur and singing ability may be based on plush toys that play music to help children fall asleep. Its round shape resembles a powder puff or a cream puff, and its pink color, rubbery skin, and ability to learn Bounce are similar to a rubber ball. It may also be inspired by the mythical moon rabbit due to its rabbit-like ears, Fairy typing (which tends to be associated with the Moon), and the fact that it evolves from Jigglypuff using a Moon Stone.\n\nName origin\nWigglytuff may be a combination of wiggly and tuft (a bunch of hair) or tough.\nPukurin may be a combination of \u3077\u304f\u3077\u304f pukupuku (cute and chubby), \u3077\u308a\u3077\u308a puripuri (angrily or in a huff; referring to its personality), \u304f\u308a\u304f\u308a kurikuri (big and round), and \u30d7\u30ea\u30f3 purin (pudding; referring to its soft body). It may also involve \u98a8\u8239 f\u016bsen (balloon) and \u81a8\u308c\u308b fukureru (to become inflated).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30d7\u30af\u30ea\u30f3 Pukurin\n\nFrom \u3077\u304f\u3077\u304f pukupuku, \u3077\u308a\u3077\u308a puripuri, \u304f\u308a\u304f\u308a kurikuri, \u30d7\u30ea\u30f3 purin, and possibly \u98a8\u8239 f\u016bsen and \u81a8\u308c\u308b fukureru\n\n\n French\n\nGrodoudou\n\nFrom gros, doux, doudou, and roudoudou\n\n\n Spanish\n\nWigglytuff\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nKnuddeluff\n\nFrom knuddeln and fluff\n\n\n Italian\n\nWigglytuff\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ud478\ud06c\ub9b0 Pukurin\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u80d6\u53ef\u4e01 P\u00e0ngk\u011bd\u012bng\n\nFrom \u80d6 p\u00e0ng, \u5e03\u4e01 b\u00f9d\u012bng, and a partial transcription of the Japanese name\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u80d6\u53ef\u4e01 Buhnh\u00f3d\u012bng*\u80a5\u6ce2\u7403 F\u00e8ihb\u014dk\u00e0uh*\n\nFrom \u80d6 buhn and \u5e03\u4e01 boud\u012bng, and a partial Mandarin-based transcription of the Japanese nameFrom \u80a5 f\u00e8ih, \u6ce2 b\u014d, \u7403 k\u00e0uh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0935\u093f\u0917\u094d\u0932\u0940\u091f\u092b\u093c Wigglytuff\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nViglitafas\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0412\u0438\u0433\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0444 Vigglitaff\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e1e\u0e39\u0e04\u0e39\u0e23\u0e34\u0e19 Phukhurin\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nNurse Joy's Wigglytuff\nJiggly\nWigglytuff (MPJ)\nWigglytuff (Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky)\nWigglytuff (UNITE)\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0039: Jigglypuff\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0041: Zubat\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Wigglytuff_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4143061\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monNormal-type Pok\u00e9monFairy-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to three femalesPok\u00e9mon in the Fast experience groupPink-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 12 Pok\u00e9monFairy group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hoenn Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Unova Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 425Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special DefensePok\u00e9mon whose base HP stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 435Pok\u00e9mon with 19 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that have had their type changedPok\u00e9mon whose base stats changed in Generation VI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 11 October 2024, at 14:51.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
