It has narrow eyes and several sharp teeth. Just below its head is a large hood with a face-like pattern. This pattern has over 20 possible variations. The pattern typically has two red and yellow eyespots outlined in black, a wide black streak resembling an upturned mouth, and a black V-shaped stripe above the eyespots.\nArbok is capable of crushing opponents by coiling its body around them and squeezing them tightly. It can even flatten steel oil drums. If it encounters an enemy, it raises its head, mimics, and stuns the opponent using the frightening pattern on its body. It can also make eerie sounds by expelling air from its mouth. It has been stated that if any part of Arbok's body except for the head is cut off, it can regrow the rest of its body again in a few weeks. It also can detect vibrations as shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Whistle Stop. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Misty Mermaid shows that Arbok can spend long periods underwater and survive in aquatic environments. One particular Arbok could change its pattern at any time to increase power to different stats and get invulnerability to status conditions, if the pattern is uncovered.\nArbok is territorial. It lashes out at intruders with long fangs tipped with deadly venom. Vengeful in nature, it will not give up a chase once it targets its prey or an opponent, no matter how far. It makes its home in grassy savannas and plains, but it can also be found in forests and desolate wastelands alongside its pre-evolved form Ekans. In the wild, it hunts smaller Pok\u00e9mon such as Wooper, and also preys on Pidgey and Spearow Eggs. When hunting, it uses the pattern on its hood to immobilize prey, then constricts them, and finally poisons the target to finish them off and eat them. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Arbok is known to display its belly while sleeping. It is theorized that Arbok does this to scare other Pok\u00e9mon away by showcasing its fearsome markings.\nBefore Generation II, Arbok and its pre-evolved form, Ekans, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Glare.\n\nEvolution\nArbok evolves from Ekans.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nEkans\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nArbok\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness: Arbok is part of Team AWD, a team that pursues the challenges of Zero Isle.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky: Team AWD are shown in the Team Charm Special Episode, being the major antagonists of the story.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #024\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nIt is rumored that the ferocious warning markings on its belly differ from area to area.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nThe frightening patterns on its belly have been studied.

It evolved from Ekans in Dig Those Diglett!, thus marking the species' debut. It was extremely loyal to her and was her primary battling Pok\u00e9mon until A Poached Ego!, when she set it free along with James's Weezing so it could protect a wild group of Ekans and Koffing.\n\nOther\nIn The Ultimate Test, Ash used an Arbok in the Pok\u00e9mon League Admissions Exam.

Its appearance in Generation I, Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen, and from Generation IV onward differs from the variants shown in Generation II and in Pok\u00e9mon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald. This supports Pok\u00e9dex text which notes differences between Arbok in different areas; however, its markings in Johto- and Hoenn-based remakes differ from those in the original games set in those regions.\nOther media have featured additional variations. In Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, Arbok can change their own patterns, as done by Agatha's Arbok. The Dark Arbok card from the TCG depicts another pattern.\n\nOrigin\nArbok seems to be based on the Indian cobra due to its venomous bite and hood markings. It may also be based on the king cobra, which is the world's largest venomous snake. Its powerful constriction is reminiscent of boas, anacondas, and pythons. Its frightening face-like belly patterns may be inspired by masks or face paint. The fact that it is in the Dragon Egg Group and its ability to learn Glare may be a reference to the legendary basilisk, a venomous, serpentine dragon said to be able to kill people with its stare.\n\nName origin\nArbok is cobra spelled backwards, but with the c replaced with a k.[1]\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30a2\u30fc\u30dc\u30c3\u30af Arbok\n\nFrom cobra spelled backwards\n\n\n French\n\nArbok\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Spanish\n\nArbok\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n German\n\nArbok\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Italian\n\nArbok\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc544\ubcf4\ud06c Arbok\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u963f\u67cf\u602a \u0100b\u00f3gu\u00e0i\n\nFrom the transcription of Japanese name and \u602a gu\u00e0i\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u963f\u67cf\u602a \u00c1baakgwaai\n\nFrom the transcription of Japanese name and \u602a gwaai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d0\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5\u05e7 Arbok\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0906\u0930\u092c\u0949\u0915 Arbok\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nArbokas\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0410\u0440\u0431\u043e\u043a Arbok\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e1a\u0e47\u0e2d\u0e01 Abok\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nJessie's Arbok\nArbok (MPJ)\nTeam AWD\nReferences\n\n\u2191 The Official Pok\u00e9mon Handbook, p. 36\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0023: Ekans\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0025: Pikachu\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Arbok_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4140234\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monPoison-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupPurple-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 02 Pok\u00e9monField group Pok\u00e9monDragon group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kitakami Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 438Pok\u00e9mon with a unique base stat totalPok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 448Pok\u00e9mon with 19 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monShadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XDPok\u00e9mon whose base stats changed in Generation VII\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 6 October 2024, at 17:37.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
