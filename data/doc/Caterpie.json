Yellow ring-shaped markings down the sides of its segmented body resemble its eyes and are meant to scare off predators. Its most notable characteristic is the bright red antenna (osmeterium) on its head, which releases a stench to repel predators. Despite these features and its camouflage in green foliage, Caterpie is often preyed upon by Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon. Its four tiny feet are tipped with suction cups, permitting this Pok\u00e9mon to scale most surfaces with minimal effort.\nCaterpie is easy to capture and grows quickly, making it ideal for new Trainers. As Caterpie grow and develop over time, they will shed their skin many times before finally cocooning themselves in thick silk. It can also spit this silk to entangle foes as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Ash Catches a Pok\u00e9mon. It has a voracious appetite, driving it to eat a hundred leaves daily. It will even eat leaves bigger than itself. According to the 54th chapter of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, its favorite food is the Vermilion flower. Caterpie lives in temperate forests and jungles. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Caterpie is known to sleep occasionally while using String Shot. On occasion, it drools out strings instead of saliva[1].\n\n\nEvolution\nCaterpie evolves into Metapod, which evolves into Butterfree.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nCaterpie\u00a0Bug\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nMetapod\u00a0Bug\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nButterfree\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Caterpie is rescued in the first mission of the game.

With the help of her fishing rod and Red's Pika, Yellow saved a Caterpie from its tree, which was targeted by a Fire attack. Caterpie then followed Yellow to Route 9, where she and Blue were training. It took Yellow a whole day to properly catch this Caterpie with a Pok\u00e9 Ball, but once she prevailed, Yellow welcomed Caterpie to her team and called it \"Kitty\". It then became one of Yellow's most useful Pok\u00e9mon, whose string was commonly used to make floaters. However, in the battle against Lance, Yellow did not have a Pok\u00e9dex, which she needed to stop her Pok\u00e9mon from evolving.

They are known as the Worm Pok\u00e9mon.\nIn early episodes of Pok\u00e9mon the Series, Caterpie's mouth was incorrectly colored yellow. It wasn't until Wings 'N' Things that Caterpie's mouth started to be colored green.\nUntil the release of Pok\u00e9mon Platinum, when it became able to learn Bug Bite, Caterpie was unable to do anything to a Ghost type except struggling and lowering its Speed. It shares this trait with its evolution, Metapod. This is also true for Weedle, and its evolution, Kakuna, against Steel types before Pok\u00e9mon Platinum was released.\nDue to this, it was impossible to complete a Generation I game using only Caterpie or Metapod, since Struggle couldn't hit Ghost types at the time.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon the Series and the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga, Caterpie holds the record as the Pok\u00e9mon who takes the least amount of time to evolve twice, taking only one episode in the animated series and one chapter in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures.\nPoliwag and Togepi also share this record, but in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures only.\nPrior to Generation VI, Caterpie's shape was .\nIn Ash Catches a Pok\u00e9mon, when Caterpie evolves into Metapod, the process was similar to a real caterpillar going into pupation. Later episodes[2] show Caterpie evolving like the rest of the Pok\u00e9mon do.\nCaterpie is tied with Weedle, Magikarp, Igglybuff, Carvanha, Attack Forme Deoxys, and Stonjourner for having the lowest base Special Defense stat of all Pok\u00e9mon.\nOrigin\nCaterpie is based on a caterpillar,[3] perhaps specifically the Asian swallowtail, eastern tiger swallowtail, or spicebush swallowtail due to its green body, yellow eyespots, and red osmeterium. The tip of its tail resembles the horn that many species of hawk moth larvae have on their rear ends.\n\nName origin\nCaterpie may be a corruption, or shortening, of caterpillar.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30ad\u30e3\u30bf\u30d4\u30fc Caterpie\n\nFrom \u30ad\u30e3\u30bf\u30d4\u30e9\u30fc kyatapir\u0101\n\n\n French\n\nChenipan\n\nFrom chenille and chenapan\n\n\n Spanish\n\nCaterpie\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n German\n\nRaupy\n\nFrom Raupe\n\n\n Italian\n\nCaterpie\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uce90\ud130\ud53c Caterpie\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u7da0\u6bdb\u87f2 / \u7eff\u6bdb\u866b L\u01dcm\u00e1och\u00f3ng\n\nFrom \u7da0 / \u7eff l\u01dc and \u6bdb\u6bdb\u87f2 / \u6bdb\u6bdb\u866b m\u00e1om\u00e1och\u00f3ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u7da0\u6bdb\u87f2 Luhkm\u00f2uhch\u00f9hng\n\nFrom \u7da0 luhk and \u6bdb\u6bdb\u87f2 m\u00f2uhm\u00f2uhch\u00f9hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Bulgarian\n\n\u041a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043f\u0438 Katerpi\n\nTranscription as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05e7\u05d8\u05e8\u05e4\u05d9 Caterpy\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0915\u0948\u091f\u0930\u092a\u0940 Caterpie\n\nTranscription of English/Japanese name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nKaterpis\n\nFrom English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043f\u0438 Katerpi\n\nTranscription of English/Japanese name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e04\u0e32\u0e40\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e1b\u0e35 Khatoepi\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nAsh's Caterpie\nGoh's Caterpie\nKitty\nCaterpie (Red and Blue Rescue Team)\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 Caterpie's Big Dilemma and Butterfree and Me!\n\n\u2191 Nintendo Dream Volume 84, February/March 2003 (English translation written by Jacob Newcomb and commissioned by Dr. Lava)\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0009: Blastoise\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0011: Metapod\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Caterpie_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4148166\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monBug-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupGreen-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 14 Pok\u00e9monBug group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 195Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became both Special Attack and Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 15 max performance starsPok\u00e9mon that cannot learn TMsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monBody style 02 Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 18 October 2024, at 00:38.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
