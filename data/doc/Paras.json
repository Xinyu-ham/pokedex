Its ovoid body is segmented, and it has three pairs of legs. The foremost pair of legs is the largest and has sharp claws at the tips. There are five specks on its forehead and three teeth on either side of its mouth. It has circular eyes with large pseudopupils.\nRed-and-yellow mushrooms known as tochukaso grow on this Pok\u00e9mon's back. The mushrooms can be removed at any time and grow from spores that are doused on this Pok\u00e9mon's back at birth by the mushroom on its mother's back. Tochukaso are parasitic in nature, drawing their nutrients from the host Paras's body in order to grow and exerting some command over the Pok\u00e9mon's actions. For example, Paras drains nutrients from tree roots due to commands from the mushrooms. The mushrooms are also popular among collectors and have medicinal uses, usually involving extended life. Prior to Generation III, Spore was its signature move.\nParas can often be found in caves; however, it can also thrive in damp forests. In the Alola region, the mushrooms on its back do not grow well. This is thought to be from a lack of moisture or nutrients.\n\nEvolution\nParas evolves into Parasect.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nParas\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Grass\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nParasect\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Grass\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #046\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nBurrows to suck tree roots.

They are all known as the Mushroom Pok\u00e9mon.\nAll six Pok\u00e9mon also share a common move, Spore; and Ability, Effect Spore.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon GO, they all give more Stardust than most other Pok\u00e9mon upon capture.\nParas can be seen as a counterpart to Morelull. Both share the Grass type, the same base stat total of 285, evolve at Level 24, both are mushroom-based Pok\u00e9mon and thus can learn Spore, and both can be found in the wild in Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon, taking the place of the other depending on the time, with Paras being found during the day and Morelull at night.\nOrigin\n  Bulbanews has an article related to this subject: On the Origin of Species: Paras and Parasect  \nThe fungus on Paras is identified as tochukaso, an endoparasitoid that replaces the host tissue and can affect the behavior of its insect host. The base insect appears to be a cicada nymph. In concept, it could be inspired by ants that are infected with mushroom spores that take control of the host ant's brain and sprout from its head or back. It may also draw inspiration from Massospora, a genus of fungi which include species that specifically infect cicadas.\n\nName origin\nParas may be derived from parasite, referring to the parasitic mushroom growing on its back.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30d1\u30e9\u30b9 Paras\n\nFrom parasite\n\n\n French\n\nParas\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Spanish\n\nParas\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n German\n\nParas\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Italian\n\nParas\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ud30c\ub77c\uc2a4 Paras\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u6d3e\u62c9\u65af P\u00e0il\u0101s\u012b\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u6d3e\u62c9\u65af P\u0101ail\u0101ais\u012b*\u8611\u83c7\u87f2 M\u00f2hg\u016bch\u00f9hng*\n\nTranscription of Japanese nameFrom \u8611\u83c7 m\u00f2hg\u016b and \u87f2 ch\u00f9hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05e4\u05e8\u05e1 Paras\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092a\u0948\u0930\u0938 Paras\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Icelandic\n\nSn\u00edkill*\n\nFrom sn\u00edkill\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nParas\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0441 Paras\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e23\u0e31\u0e2a Pharat\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0045: Vileplume\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0047: Parasect\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Paras_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128693\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monBug-type Pok\u00e9monGrass-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupRed-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 14 Pok\u00e9monBug group Pok\u00e9monGrass group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hisui Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 285Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 18 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monShadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 16:25.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
