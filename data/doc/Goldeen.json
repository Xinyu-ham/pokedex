It has circular blue eyes with orange lids and prominent pink lips. On its forehead is a large horn, which is larger on a male than on a female. It has a small, wavy dorsal fin surrounded by an orange patch and long pectoral fins with orange markings at the bases. Goldeen's billowing tail fin is orange around the base and turns white toward the edges. Its tail is admired by many for its beauty and similarity to a ballroom dress.\nGoldeen has a wild temperament and will use its horn to smash its way to freedom if kept in an aquarium. It competes with others of its kind to determine which has the strongest, thickest horn. Humans swimming near it must exercise caution lest Goldeen rams them. Goldeen is a very common sight in any body of fresh water, including ponds, lakes, and rivers. It can be seen swimming upstream in large schools during the breeding season in spring. Its strong fins allow it to maintain a steady speed of five knots while swimming upstream. It is known as the \"Water Dancer\" due to its elegant movements in the water. In Generation I, Waterfall was its signature move.\n\nEvolution\nGoldeen evolves into Seaking.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nGoldeen\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nSeaking\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #118\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nIts tail fin billows like an elegant ballroom dress, giving it the nickname of the Water Queen.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nWhen it is time for them to lay eggs, they can be seen swimming up rivers and falls in large groups.\n\n\nStadium \n\nIts beautiful tail fin billows and flutters like an elegant dress.

Brawl\nSuper Smash Bros.\nWhen released from a Pok\u00e9 Ball, Goldeen will use Splash, having no effect on the battle.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Melee\nWhen released from a Pok\u00e9 Ball, Goldeen will use Splash, having no effect on the battle.\nGoldeen is also a Pok\u00e9float. It will appear from the bottom of the screen but quickly drop down to the bottom again, knocking out any character it hits.\n\nTrophy information\nThese Water-types are often referred to as \"water dancers,\" as their elegant fins make them incredible agile underwater. They can even travel upstream in rapids at a speed of five knots; of course, they're not quite as nimble on dry land. Goldeen's Horn Drill is so strong that it can KO an enemy with one strike if it connects.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Brawl\nGoldeen will sometimes be found in a Pok\u00e9 Ball and will use Splash when released. It does nothing to affect the battle. On the official blog, Masahiro Sakurai commented that Goldeen appearing at the most critical of times is in keeping with Murphy's Law.[1]\n\nTrophy information\n\"A Goldfish Pok\u00e9mon. In contrast to its elegant appearance, it has a wild temperament, and its attack with its horn is severe. Among the techniques it can master, Horn Drill is especially reliable. It evolves into Seaking, but if raised without evolving, it can learn the powerful Bug-type Megahorn. There are male and female Goldeen--the male's horn is longer.\"\n\nSuper Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U\n Goldeen trophy in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS\nGoldeen will sometimes appear from a Pok\u00e9 Ball or even a Master Ball. As in the previous games, it uses Splash when released, having no effect on the battle.\nGoldeen also appears as a trophy in both versions of the game.\n\nTrophy information\nNA: This Water-type Pok\u00e9mon sports a fancy horn on its head. An excellent swimmer, it can literally swim up waterfalls. In the world of Pok\u00e9mon, this elegant Pok\u00e9mon has a variety of effective moves in battle. In Smash Bros., however, all it can use is an ineffective Splash attack.\nPAL: A Water-type Pok\u00e9mon with a distinctive horn. Thanks to its powerful fins, Goldeen can swim comfortably through the most torrential waters and even up waterfalls. It's known for both its strength and grace. That said, don't expect it to make a big splash in this game - just a little one when it uses Splash... It's super ineffective!\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nGoldeen returns as a Pok\u00e9 Ball summon, retaining the same behavior as before.\n\n\nTrivia\n Gyopin (\u30ae\u30e7\u30d4\u30f3)'s front sprite from the Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver Spaceworld '97 demo.\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue beta, Goldeen was originally known as \"Goldy\".\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver Spaceworld '97 demo, Goldeen was intended to have a pre-evolution named Gyopin (\u30ae\u30e7\u30d4\u30f3), which evolved into it at level 16. A back sprite was also seen in the assets for Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green.[2].\nGoldeen's number in the Sinnoh Pok\u00e9dex and the Johto Pok\u00e9dex are the same: 078.\nGoldeen and its evolution were the only Pok\u00e9mon that could learn Waterfall in Generation I, before the move was an HM.\nGoldeen shares a fairly similar in-game cry to Caterpie, being only .07 seconds longer.\nEven though Goldeen uses Splash in all five Super Smash Bros. games, as well as Pok\u00e9mon Quest, it has no way of learning the move in any core Pok\u00e9mon game.\nGoldeen's Pok\u00e9mon SoulSilver Pok\u00e9dex entry claims it can swim at \"5 knots per hour.\" This is technically incorrect, as a knot is already a measurement of distance over time (nautical miles per hour).\nTogether with Magikarp, Rattata, Ninjask, Pichu, and Seedot, Goldeen is the easiest Pok\u00e9mon to catch in Pok\u00e9mon Ranger, with only one loop necessary.\nOrigin\nGoldeen seems to be based on the Tosakin (curly fantail) breed of goldfish due to its flat tail and red-and-white scales. It might also be inspired by the K\u014dhaku variety of koi fish. Its billowing tail and prominent lips and eyelids give it a feminine appearance reminiscent of a queen wearing a dress and makeup. This royal theme may come from the Japanese word for goldfish which is \u91d1\u9b5a Kingyo. Its horn may be a reference to Matsya, a giant horned fish that is one of the avatars assumed by the Hindu deity Vishnu.\n\nName origin\nGoldeen may be a combination of goldfish or golden and queen.\nTosakinto may be derived from \u571f\u4f50\u91d1 tosakin (curly fantail goldfish), a distinctive breed of goldfish.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30c8\u30b5\u30ad\u30f3\u30c8 Tosakinto\n\nFrom \u571f\u4f50\u91d1 tosakin\n\n\n French\n\nPoissir\u00e8ne\n\nFrom poisson, sir\u00e8ne, and reine\n\n\n Spanish\n\nGoldeen\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nGoldini\n\nSimilar to English name\n\n\n Italian\n\nGoldeen\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ucf58\uce58 Konchi\n\nFrom unicorn and -\uce58 chi\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u89d2\u91d1\u9b5a / \u89d2\u91d1\u9c7c Ji\u01ceoj\u012bny\u00fa\n\nFrom \u89d2 ji\u01ceo and \u91d1\u9b5a / \u91d1\u9c7c j\u012bny\u00fa\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u89d2\u91d1\u9b5a Gokg\u0101my\u00f9h*\u7368\u89d2\u91d1\u9b5a Duhkgokg\u0101m'y\u00f9h\n\nFrom \u89d2 gok and \u91d1\u9b5a g\u0101my\u00f9hFrom \u7368\u89d2 duhkgok and \u91d1\u9b5a g\u0101my\u00f9h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0917\u094b\u0932\u094d\u0921\u0940\u0928 Goldeen\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Icelandic\n\nGullinn*\n\nFrom gullinn\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0413\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0438\u043d Goldin\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e42\u0e17\u0e0b\u0e32\u0e04\u0e34\u0e19\u0e42\u0e15\u0e30 Thosakhinto\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nMisty's Goldeen\nReferences\n\n\u2191 (June 5, 2007). \"What Are Pok\u00e9 Balls?\" Smash Bros.
