It has diamond-shaped ears with beige insides, black eyes, a round, black nose, and two pointed teeth protruding from its upper jaw. Its head, muzzle, and chest are covered in shaggy, beige fur, except for two oval sections around each eye and ear. Long tufts of fur grow behind its elbows and around its ankles. Its underside is black, and it has a billowing, beige tail that is bent in the middle. Each paw has three toes and a round, pink pad.\nArcanine is a fiercely brave and loyal Pok\u00e9mon. It is capable of running 6,200 miles in 24 hours with a speed and grace reminiscent of flight. In Generation II, Extreme Speed was its signature move. Arcanine has long been admired for its beauty and speed, and anyone who hears its bark will grovel before it. The source of its power is a flame blazing wildly inside its body. Being the result of an evolution via Evolution stone, Arcanine is rarely found in the wild, but when found, it is usually seen living in prairies, and Pok\u00e9mon Snap has also shown it living in active volcanoes. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode On Cloud Arcanine, it was shown that it stashes food in its mane and carries it to its nest for its young. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Arcanine is known to sleep at supremely comfortable sleeping spot.[1] Arcanine when it sleeps is said to be similar to how an innocent child sleeps.\nIn some locations, such as China, Arcanine is seen as a Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, where it's revered for its speed and power; it is also categorized as Legendary in An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS.\n\nForms\nArcanine has a regional form: Hisuian Arcanine.\nIn Hisui, Arcanine has a different look due to the volcanic activity of the environment it lives in. Its body fur is red-orange while its muzzle, mane, tail, eyebrows, and tufts of fur behind its elbows and around its ankles are gray, and the insides of its ears are light gray. The gray fur is made out of igneous rock components. Its cheek mane, ankle fur, and tail form into curls. Its elbow fur resemble wings. It has a large horn in the center of its head and three small horns between its head and ears. Its mane form into curled clumps at the back of its neck and large rectangular clumps on the sides and bottom of its neck. The rectangular clumps have light red-orange markings on them.\nHisuian Arcanine uses its fangs while engulfed in flames to snap at foes. Despite how deceivingly bulky Hisuian Arcanine is, it moves around nimbly like a dancer. This allows it to lead opponents in a merry chase while avoiding them at the same time. It lives in coastal mountainsides.\n\nNoble Pok\u00e9mon\nA special Hisuian Arcanine is worshiped by the Hisui people due to him being descended from one of the 10 ancient Pok\u00e9mon who received a blessing from Arceus. He is one of the noble Pok\u00e9mon who resides in Cobalt Coastlands watched by a Warden Palina.\n\nEvolution\nArcanine evolves from Growlithe.\nHisuian Arcanine evolves from Hisuian Growlithe.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nArcanine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nGrowlithe\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nArcanine\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHisuian Arcanine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nGrowlitheHisuian Form\u00a0Fire\u00a0\u00a0Rock\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nArcanineHisuian Form\u00a0Fire\u00a0\u00a0Rock\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus: Two Hisuian Arcanine are supporting characters, one of which is a boss. These Arcanine are father and son, with the father having died to save his pup. Later on, the son evolved and took his father's place as a Noble Pok\u00e9mon. Both are descendants of the Arcanine that the Ancient hero befriended ages ago. They were beloved by the people of the Hisui region along with the other Noble and Ride Pok\u00e9mon.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #059\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nA Pok\u00e9mon that has been admired since the past for its beauty.

It defeated Giovanni's Kingler, despite the type disadvantage, but was then completely overwhelmed by Mewtwo. It has made multiple reappearances since then as one of Gary's most commonly used Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nOther\nIn Fire and Ice, Pete Pebbleman used an Arcanine during his battle against Ash at the Indigo Plateau Conference. Despite the type disadvantage, Arcanine easily defeated Kingler by dodging its Bubble attack and using Dragon Rage. Pikachu then managed to defeat the Arcanine with Thunderbolt after its Fire Blast melted the Ice Field.\nIn The Stolen Stones, Keegan owned an Arcanine, while Ramona owned two others. Keegan's Arcanine was nicknamed Arcky. The Fire-type Pok\u00e9mon were used to deliver some Fire Stones that were meant to be used as prizes for a local Fire Pok\u00e9mon tournament. Keegan and Ramona later used their Arcanine to save Ash, Misty, and Brock from falling off a cliff.\nIn On Cloud Arcanine, Drew and May wanted to catch a female Arcanine for use in a Pok\u00e9mon Contest. When it was discovered that she had a litter of Growlithe puppies to take care of, the two decided to leave Arcanine alone.\nIn Tactics Theatrics!!, Tucker owns an Arcanine. Nicknamed the \"Fiery Fleet-Footed\" Arcanine, it was used along with a Swampert to battle Ash and his Swellow and Corphish at the Battle Dome. Both of Tucker's Pok\u00e9mon were eventually defeated after a hard-fought battle.\nIn flashbacks in Keeping In Top Forme!, Marley used an Arcanine when she was first attacked by Team Rocket, in order to send them blasting off.

It is the only Pok\u00e9mon species to have \"Legendary Pok\u00e9mon\" as the Pok\u00e9mon category.\nHowever, Arcanine was seen in an engraving along with legendary birds Moltres, Articuno, and Zapdos in Pok\u00e9mon Emergency!.\nMany of Arcanine's Pok\u00e9dex entries\u2014starting with the one in the Japanese Pok\u00e9mon Red\u2014reference the real world, specifically China.\nArcanine and its pre-evolved form are the only Pok\u00e9mon with a male-female ratio of 3:1 that aren't in the Human-Like Egg Group.\nHisuian Arcanine and its pre-evolved form were designed by Megumi Mizutani.[2]\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus's internal code, Hisuian Arcanine's Hidden Ability is Justified instead of Rock Head.\nOrigin\nArcanine may be based on the Ryukyuan \u30b7\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc shisa, or \u72db\u72ac komainu, mythical creatures that resemble a mix between lions and dogs. Given its earliest Pok\u00e9dex entries state it's from China, however, it may more precisely derive from the \u7345 Chinese guardian lion. Statues of komainu in pairs are used as guardians that invite good spirits and repel evil ones. Its stripes and coloration are reminiscent of tigers. It could also be based on the xiezhi, a mythical fire-eating dog with similarities to lions and tigers. It may also draw inspiration from dogs with brindle (\"tiger-striped\") coat patterns, such as the \u7532\u6590\u72ac Kai Ken.\nIn its Hisuian Form, its Rock typing and appearance may be based on the komainu statues. Its ankle fur and tail resemble plumes of smoke.\n\nName origin\nArcanine may be a combination of arcane and canine.\nWindie may refer to wind or windy, reflecting its defining nature of being fast like the wind, further emphasized by Extreme Speed being its signature move in Generation II.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30a6\u30a4\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3 Windie\n\nFrom wind or windy\n\n\n French\n\nArcanin\n\nSimilar to English name\n\n\n Spanish\n\nArcanine\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nArkani\n\nFrom arcane, canis, and Vulkan\n\n\n Italian\n\nArcanine\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc708\ub514 Windi\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u98a8\u901f\u72d7 / \u98ce\u901f\u72d7 F\u0113ngs\u00f9g\u01d2u\n\nFrom \u98a8\u901f / \u98ce\u901f f\u0113ngs\u00f9 and \u72d7 g\u01d2u\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u98a8\u901f\u72d7 F\u016bngch\u016bkg\u00e1u*\u5949\u795e\u72ac Fuhngs\u0101nhy\u00fan*\n\nFrom \u98a8\u901f f\u016bngch\u016bk and \u72d7 g\u01d2uFrom \u5949\u795e fuhngs\u0101n and \u72ac hy\u00fan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0906\u0930\u094d\u0915\u0947\u0928\u093e\u0907\u0928 Arcanine\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nArkaninas\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0410\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0439\u043d Arkanayn\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e27\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e35 Windi\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nGary's Arcanine\nArchy\nRegional form\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 Tweet by \u6c34\u8c37\u6075 (@megtany).
