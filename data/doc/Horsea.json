It has red eyes, a long, tubular mouth, and three spike-like fins on either side of its head. Its ridged belly and single dorsal fin are cream-colored. Highly adept in the water, it uses its dorsal fin to swim in any direction while facing forward. It has a tightly curled tail that it can use as both a balance and an anchor when caught in a strong current. In safer environments, it uses its tail to play with other members of its species.\nHorsea feeds on insects and moss gathered from rocks. If Horsea senses danger, it sprays water or dense black ink from its mouth at its attacker. It can shoot more precisely at insects flying above the surface of the water. Horsea nests in coral reefs and islands throughout oceans with gentle currents. Many Eggs are laid every year, and the young are raised by the male Horsea rather than the female. Horsea swims with dance-like motions, creating whirlpools in the process. Horsea tend to compete with each other to see who can create the biggest whirlpool.\n\n\nEvolution\nHorsea evolves into Seadra, which evolves into Kingdra.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nHorsea\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nSeadra\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nKingdra\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Dragon\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #116\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nKnown to shoot down flying bugs with precision blasts of ink from the surface of the water.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nIf it senses any danger, it will vigorously spray water or a special type of ink from its mouth.\n\n\nStadium \n\nUses its tail to keep its balance while spraying ink from its mouth.

This two finned design was referenced in Alola, Kanto!\nOrigin\nHorsea seems to be based on a seahorse.

Its ability to shoot ink is reminiscent of a squid, and the shape of its snout and Sniper Ability are reminiscent of a water gun.\n\nName origin\nHorsea may be derived from seahorse and horsie (childish term for a horse).\nTattu may be derived from \u7adc tatsu (dragon) or \u7adc\u306e\u843d\u3068\u3057\u5b50 tatsu-no-otoshigo (seahorse, lit. \"illegitimate child of a dragon\").\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30bf\u30c3\u30c4\u30fc Tattu\n\nFrom \u7adc tatsu or \u7adc\u306e\u843d\u3068\u3057\u5b50 tatsu-no-otoshigo\n\n\n French\n\nHypotrempe\n\nFrom hippocampe, hypo-, and tremper\n\n\n Spanish\n\nHorsea\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nSeeper\n\nFrom Seepferd\n\n\n Italian\n\nHorsea\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc3d8\ub4dc\ub77c Ssodra\n\nFrom \uc3d8\ub2e4 ssoda and dragon\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u58a8\u6d77\u99ac / \u58a8\u6d77\u9a6c M\u00f2h\u01ceim\u01ce\n\nFrom \u58a8 m\u00f2 and \u6d77\u99ac / \u6d77\u9a6c h\u01ceim\u01ce\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u58a8\u6d77\u99ac Mahkh\u00f3im\u00e1h*\u5674\u58a8\u6d77\u99ac P\u0101nmahkh\u00f3im\u00e1h*\n\nFrom \u58a8 mahk and \u6d77\u99ac h\u00f3im\u00e1hFrom \u5674\u58a8 p\u0101n mahk and \u6d77\u99ac h\u00f3im\u00e1h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0939\u0949\u0930\u094d\u0938\u0940 Horsea\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0425\u043e\u0440\u0441\u0438 Khorsi\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e17\u0e31\u0e17\u0e17\u0e39 Thatthu\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nMisty's Horsea\nHorsea (MPJ)\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0115: Kangaskhan\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0117: Seadra\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Horsea_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4143148\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monWater-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupBlue-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 05 Pok\u00e9monWater 1 group Pok\u00e9monDragon group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hoenn Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 295Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with 16 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 11 October 2024, at 16:24.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
