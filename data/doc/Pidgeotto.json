It is covered with brown feathers and has a cream-colored face, underside, and flight feathers. It has a crest of pinkish-red feathers on its head and black, angular markings behind its black eyes. The plumage of its tail has alternating red and yellow feathers with ragged tips. Pidgeotto's beak and legs are pink. Two of its toes point forward, while one points backward. Additionally, it has powerful, sharp talons that it uses to grasp prey.\nPidgeotto is a powerful flier capable of carrying prey several miles to its nest. It has amazing vision, which helps it locate preferred prey Pok\u00e9mon such as Exeggcute and Magikarp. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Ash Catches a Pok\u00e9mon depicts it preying on Caterpie. Pidgeotto claims a sprawling territory of more than 60 miles (100 kilometers), which it defends fiercely. Its nest is usually in the center of its territory and it circles its territory throughout the day, looking out for food and intruders. It is most often found in temperate forests.\nIn Generation III, Feather Dance was its signature move, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding.\n\nEvolution\nPidgeotto evolves from Pidgey and evolves into Pidgeot.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nPidgey\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPidgeotto\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nPidgeot\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon: Magikarp Jump: A Pidgeotto may appear as part of several events, where it will carry away the player's Magikarp when it jumps (and thereby force it to retire).

However, Pidgeotto is unable to learn Peck.\nOrigin\nDespite its name, Pidgeotto does not resemble a pigeon so much as a bird of prey such as an osprey or an eagle due to its large size and predatory behavior. It also shares some characteristics with various passerine birds such as sparrows, chickadees, waxwings, and wrens. Its red crest is somewhat similar to the crests of cockatoos. The black markings around its eyes are reminiscent of Ra and Horus, the sun and sky gods of Egyptian mythology who were depicted with the heads of falcons.\n\nName origin\nPidgeotto may be a combination of pigeon and the Italian diminutive suffix -otto. It is also very similar to the romanized spelling of Pidgeot's Japanese name, \u30d4\u30b8\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8 pijotto.\nPigeon is literally pigeon.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30d4\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3 Pigeon\n\nFrom pigeon\n\n\n French\n\nRoucoups\n\nFrom roucouler and coups\n\n\n Spanish\n\nPidgeotto\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nTauboga\n\nFrom Taube and Bogen\n\n\n Italian\n\nPidgeotto\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ud53c\uc8e4 Pijon\n\nFrom pigeon\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u6bd4\u6bd4\u9ce5 / \u6bd4\u6bd4\u9e1f B\u01d0b\u01d0ni\u01ceo\n\nFrom the partial transcription of its Japanese name and \u9ce5 / \u9e1f ni\u01ceo\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u6bd4\u6bd4\u9ce5 Beihbeihn\u00eduh\n\nFrom the partial transcription of its Japanese name and \u9ce5 n\u00eduh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05e4\u05d9\u05d3\u05d2'\u05d9\u05d5\u05d8\u05d5 Pigiyoto\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092a\u093f\u091c\u093f\u092f\u094b\u091f\u094b Pidgeotto\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nPid\u017eeototas\n\nFrom English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041f\u0438\u0434\u0436\u0435\u043e\u0442\u0442\u043e Pidzheotto\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e40\u0e08\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19 Phichian\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nAsh's Pidgeotto\nGold's Pidgeotto\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0016: Pidgey\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0018: Pidgeot\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Pidgeotto_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4126734\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monNormal-type Pok\u00e9monFlying-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Slow experience groupBrown-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 09 Pok\u00e9monFlying group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 349Pok\u00e9mon with a unique base stat totalPok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became both Special Attack and Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 19 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monShadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 25 September 2024, at 22:39.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
