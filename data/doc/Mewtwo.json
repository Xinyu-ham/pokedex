It is a bipedal, humanoid Pok\u00e9mon with some feline features. Its body is primarily gray with a long, purple tail and a large purple underbelly. On top of its head are two short, blunt horns, and it has purple eyes. A tube extends from the back of its skull to the top of its spine, bypassing its neck. It has a defined chest and shoulders, which resemble a breastplate. The three digits on each hand and foot have spherical tips. Its tail is thick at the base but thins before ending in a small bulb.\nAccording to journals found in Kanto's Pok\u00e9mon Mansion, after discovering the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Mew and gathering some of its DNA, Mr. Fuji used it in his mansion to create Mewtwo, a modified clone of Mew with the goal to making it the most powerful Pok\u00e9mon of all. It was held and studied in the mansion where horrific gene-splicing experiments were made making the Pok\u00e9mon vicious and extremely powerful. It eventually broke free and fled the Mansion, destroying it in the process. It is widely known as one of the most powerful Pok\u00e9mon in existence and is said to have the most savage heart among all Pok\u00e9mon, lacking compassion and striking fear into its enemy with cold, glowing eyes. Mewtwo conserves energy by remaining motionless in order to unleash its full power in battle. Because it was engineered to be the ultimate opponent in battle, it can only think of defeating its foes. Though rarely seen in the wild, it is said to be resting in a dark cave somewhere.\nIn Mewtwo Strikes Back, a Mewtwo exemplified its vicious characteristics. It was shown to be capable of levitation, telepathy, mind control, memory erasure, teleporting others to another location, and the creation of powerful storms. However, it was later shown to be caring, protective, and even altruistic. Another Mewtwo in Genesect and the Legend Awakened also shared its aversion to contact with others but was much less belligerent. As shown in POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu, Mewtwo can also transfer a human's soul into a Pok\u00e9mon's body provided that said Pok\u00e9mon is in a crazed state, causing this person to gain control of the Pok\u00e9mon's body and abilities. It possesses a rivalry with Mew. As seen in Genesect and the Legend Awakened, Mewtwo can breathe in outer space. In the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga, it's revealed Mewtwo's creation wasn't possible with the amount of Mew's cells gathered, so to complete it, human cells were used instead, specifically from the Team Rocket scientist Blaine. Due to Blaine possessing some of Mewtwo's cells as well, the two became linked, which granted Blaine to ability to track its whereabouts at the cost of slowly taking his life.\nMewtwo is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Psystrike.\n\nShadow Mewtwo\nA unique variant of Mewtwo, called Shadow Mewtwo, is very similar to standard Mewtwo, but with dark gray skin, a dark gray tail with a yellowish orange tip, and a shard of Shadow Synergy Stone coming out of its shoulder. In the past, Anne was almost possessed by a Shadow Synergy Stone but was saved by Mewtwo, whom the Shadow Synergy Stone took control of and merged with instead. Under the stone's influence, Shadow Mewtwo travelled around Ferrum, draining Gaia Power from other normal Synergy Stones, which continuously increases its power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShadow Mewtwo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForms\nMewtwo has two forms. Mewtwo can Mega Evolve into either Mega Mewtwo X or Mega Mewtwo Y. Additionally, Shadow Mewtwo can Mega Evolve into Mega Shadow Mewtwo X by using Synergy Burst.\n\n Mega Mewtwo X stretching its arm.\nMega Mewtwo X is larger and bulkier than its normal state. The horns on its head are longer and extend from V-shaped ridges on its forehead. Additionally, the horns are now pointed and curve upward. It now has two tubes behind its neck, its eyes are light blue, and it has large, purple growths over its shoulders. Its torso is smooth and small compared to its long, bulky limbs, and a Y-shaped line connects the collar and underbelly. Its forearms and thighs each have two raised ridges and its digits are now longer and thinner. Its tail is slightly shorter and stiffer than before and has a curled tip. Its muscles are augmented with psychic power, giving it a grip strength of one ton and the ability to sprint 100 meters in two seconds. When using moves in battle, it is shown to be able to stretch its arms and legs.\nMega Shadow Mewtwo X greatly resembles its normal counterpart, though it maintains its dark gray coloring due to the influence of the Shadow Synergy Stone. The stone's infection spreads not only to its tail, but to both of its shoulder growths, its arm ridges, and the tips of its ears. Additionally, the Y-shaped line running across its body (now including its legs) glows the same yellowish-orange color.\nMega Mewtwo Y is smaller and lighter, losing its long tail, underbelly, and the tube behind its neck. However, it grows a long, purple appendage with a curled tip from the back of its head that is similar to its previous form's tail and also slightly resembles Jessie's hairstyle. On its head, it has two pointed, backward-curving spikes and a half-ring structure connecting to the base of each and crossing over the top of its head. Its eyes are now red and slightly larger. The digits on its hands and feet are now purple and more bulbous and the middle toe is longer than the others. A bumpy ridge similar to a sternum replaces the breastplate structure on its chest, but this form is still largely smoother than the other two. Despite its decreased size, it has phenomenal mental power and is capable of smashing buildings with a mere thought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMega Mewtwo X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMega Mewtwo Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMega Shadow Mewtwo X\n\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\n\n\nSpoiler warning: this article may contain major plot or ending details.\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Stadium: Mewtwo is the player's final opponent.\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: Mewtwo appears in its own bonus stage, where the player must attempt to hit it 25 times within the two-minute time limit to win. Playing this stage repeatedly is the fastest way to build a high score, due to the extremely high point output of 50,000,000 points per hit earned by hitting Mewtwo.\nPok\u00e9mon Ranger: Guardian Signs: Mewtwo is the final boss of the game, battled once under the control of the evil Edward \"The Thinker\", and again under Purple Eyes. Before this, it is seen charging up in Kasa's laboratory in the Sky Fortress.\nPok\u00e9mon Puzzle League: Mewtwo reveals that it organized the Puzzle League to find a worthy foe and clones Ash's Pok\u00e9mon. In the Very Hard and Super Hard modes, Mewtwo is the final opponent.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team: Mewtwo sleeps in the depths of the Western Cave. His slumber is interrupted by the arrival of Blastoise and Charizard, whom he defeats without an issue. Once the player confronts him at the deepest parts of the cave, it is possible to recruit Mewtwo.\nPok\u00e9mon Super Mystery Dungeon: Mewtwo appears, having Mega Evolved into Mega Mewtwo Y in order to telepathically link up the Pok\u00e9mon of the world together to try and stop the Tree of Life's ascent into space. Like all the other Legendary Pok\u00e9mon gathered for this effort, Mewtwo is turned into stone when Dark Matter is able to regenerate itself. After Dark Matter's defeat, Mewtwo stays at the Island of Isolation as its lone inhabitant, and can be recruited if it is defeated.\nPok\u00e9mon Quest: A telepathic Mewtwo appears as the final boss of Pok\u00e9mon Quest. It is trapped (in a vague, undefined manner) in the Chamber of Legends. It discretely takes control of MoBee to talk to the player, in order to lure the player across Tumblecube Island and collect the statues that open the Chamber. Once encountered it battles the player's Pok\u00e9mon to test itself. It did not recover fully from the time it was sealed away, and the player defeats it in battle. After being defeated, Mewtwo departs from the island. After the credits, it telepathically informs the player about Happenstance Island.\n\n\n\n\nSpoilers end here.\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #150\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nIt was created by a scientist after years of horrific gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nIts DNA is almost the same as Mew's.

The Unite License X allows the use of a Melee All Rounder Mewtwo that Mega Evolves into Mega Mewtwo X. The Unite License Y allows the use of a Ranged Attacker Mewtwo that Mega Evolves into Mega Mewtwo Y.\n\n\n\nMusic\nThis is a list of music associated with Mewtwo in the Pok\u00e9mon games.\n\n\n\nGames\n\nLocation\n\nSong name\n\nComposition\n\nArrangement\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball\n\nDuring Mewtwo's bonus stage\n\n\u2014\n\nG\u014d Ichinose[a 1]\n\nG\u014d Ichinose[a 1]\n\n\nStad\n\nDuring Pok\u00e9mon preparation, after entering VS.

All other depictions show Mewtwo being grown using laboratory equipment.\nMewtwo comes before Mew in the Pok\u00e9dex despite being created from its modified DNA.\nEven though Mewtwo is a clone of Mew, a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, Mewtwo is a Legendary Pok\u00e9mon.\nMewtwo was the first Pok\u00e9mon seen in the English dub, as it appears at the very beginning of the first dub opening.\nMewtwo has the most animated series opening appearances of any Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, with seven in Japan.\nMewtwo and Charizard share several Mega Evolution similarities. Both Pok\u00e9mon are the only ones to have two Mega Evolutions instead of one. Both of their Y Mega Evolutions were revealed before their X ones. Both Pok\u00e9mon change their typing in their X Mega Evolutions while they remain the same type in their Y Mega Evolutions. Both X Mega Evolutions are physically oriented while their Y Mega Evolutions are specially oriented.\nMewtwo is depicted on the door of Bill's lighthouse in Mystery at the Lighthouse, despite having only been seen by its creators and Team Rocket at that point in the animated series. Similarly, Mewtwo's sprite was depicted as a portrait in Viridian Gym, despite being a public area.\nThe island country of Niue released a one-dollar coin featuring Mewtwo as part of a commemorative promotion for the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, with Mewtwo on the reverse side and the nation's crest on the obverse.\nMewtwo was originally depicted as the only member of its species, being a clone of Mew. In the animated series and manga, however, it is implied that multiple Mewtwo have been created.\nMega Mewtwo Y was the first Mega Evolution revealed to the public.\nIt was also the first to appear in the animated series, even before Mega Evolution was announced.\nPrior to the announcement of Mega Evolution, Mega Mewtwo Y was referred to as its \u300c\u899a\u9192\u3057\u305f\u59ff\u300d Awakened Form.[1] This term was also used in the manga adaptation of the movie.\nMega Mewtwo Y was designed by Tomohiro Kitakaze.[2]\nMewtwo's Mega Evolutions are tied with Mega Rayquaza for the highest base stat total of all Pok\u00e9mon, with 780, excluding the unobtainable Eternamax Eternatus.\nMega Mewtwo X has the highest base Attack of all Pok\u00e9mon, as well as the highest single base stat and base Special Attack of all Fighting-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nMega Mewtwo X's Attack increase is the largest single stat increase of all Mega Evolutions, at 80 points.\nMega Mewtwo Y has the highest base Special Attack of all Pok\u00e9mon and the highest single base stat of all Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nWith a Mild Nature, perfect IVs, and optimized EVs, a Level 100 Mega Mewtwo Y's stats sum to 2038, the highest sum of any Pok\u00e9mon.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon GO, Shadow Mewtwo is the only Shadow Pok\u00e9mon that has a different aura from the other Shadow Pok\u00e9mon that isn't an Apex Shadow; instead of purple fire, it is surrounded by an aura resembling its Psychic power. It does not have a unique appearance when purified, however.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, wild Mewtwo are programmed to always be holding a Berserk Gene, but Mewtwo can't be obtained in those games without trading. Even if Mewtwo could be found in the wild, the Berserk Gene would be consumed immediately, so the item wouldn't be obtainable.\nLugia and Ho-Oh's base stats are based on Mewtwo's, with some values swapped.\nOrigin\nLike Mew, Mewtwo has some embryo characteristics, but its body structure is much larger as a result of gene splicing. It also has some characteristics of a grey alien and a salamander.\nMega Mewtwo Y, much like Mew, has characteristics of a vertebrate embryo.\n\nName origin\nMewtwo may be a combination of Mew or mutant (\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8) and two.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30df\u30e5\u30a6\u30c4\u30fc Mewtwo\n\nFrom Mew or mutant (\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8) and two\n\n\n French\n\nMewtwo\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Spanish\n\nMewtwo\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n German\n\nMewtu\n\nSimilar to English/Japanese name\n\n\n Italian\n\nMewtwo\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ubba4\uce20 Mewtwo\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u8d85\u5922 / \u8d85\u68a6 Ch\u0101om\u00e8ng\n\nFrom \u8d85 ch\u0101o and \u5922 / \u68a6 m\u00e8ng or \u5922\u5e7b / \u68a6\u5e7b M\u00e8nghu\u00e0n\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u8d85\u5922 Ch\u012bumuhng*\u8d85\u5922\u5922 Ch\u012bumuhngmuhng*\n\nFrom \u8d85 ch\u012bu and \u5922 muhng or \u5922\u5e7b MuhngwaahnFrom \u8d85 ch\u012bu and \u5922 muhng or \u5922\u5922 Muhngmuhng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Albanian\n\nMjutuMjudi\n\nFrom English nameFrom Mew and dy\n\n\n Bulgarian\n\n\u041c\u044e\u0442\u0443 Myutu\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Croatian\n\nMevtvo\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Danish\n\nMew-2*\n\nFrom Mew and 2\n\n\n Greek\n\n\u039c\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 Mi\u00fatu\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05de\u05d9\u05d5\u05d8\u05d5 Myootoo\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0942\u091f\u0942 Mewtwo\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041c\u044c\u044e\u0442\u0443 M'yutu\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Swedish\n\nMewtv\u00e5*\n\nFrom Mew and tv\u00e5\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e21\u0e34\u0e27\u0e17\u0e39 Miothu\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\n\n\n\nMew duo\nMewtwo (M01)\nMewtwo (Adventures)\nMewtwo (M16)\nMewtwo (Super Smash Bros.)\nMewtwo (Detective Pikachu)\nMewtwo (Pokk\u00e9n)\n\n\nBlue's Mewtwo\nShadow Mewtwo\nMewtwo (Unite License X)\nMewtwo (Unite License Y)\nArtificial Pok\u00e9mon\nMega Evolution\nLegendary Pok\u00e9mon\n\nNotes\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Staff of Pok\u00e9mon Pinball - G\u014d Ichinose is the only person credited for music in Pok\u00e9mon Pinball's Japanese manual.\n\n\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Staff of Pok\u00e9mon Rumble - Miki Obata is the only person credited for music in the credits of Pok\u00e9mon Rumble.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\u2191 \u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u6620\u753b\u6700\u65b0\u4f5c\u300e\u795e\u901f\u306e\u30b2\u30ce\u30bb\u30af\u30c8 \u30df\u30e5\u30a6\u30c4\u30fc\u899a\u9192\u300f\u3078\u3068\u7d9a\u304f\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u304c\u3001\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u3067\u653e\u9001\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff01\n\n\u2191 Tweet by \u5317\u98a8\u53cb\u88d5 (@kitakazeee).
