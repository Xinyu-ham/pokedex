Its body is so hard that even dynamite cannot scratch it. Its head protrudes from the center of the shell. The head has a flat snout with two pointed teeth in the lower jaw and red eyes. It has short arms that have three claws and two legs with feet that have four claws in front and one in back. The head and limbs are light brown.\nGolem grows bigger by shedding its skin once a year. The discarded shell immediately hardens when exposed to air, crumbling away and returning to the soil. Farmers are known to collect Golem's shells. Golem's soil is spread across fields to promote crop growth. However, it stops shedding with age and moss grows over its shell. As shown in the Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards, Golem's shell is hollow.\nAs shown in The Bridge Bike Gang, Golem can withdraw its head and limbs into its shell and roll at high speeds. It is dangerous when doing this, as it is unable to see and may crash into or run over anything in its path. To prevent it from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves are dug into the sides of the mountains to divert the rolling Golem's course. It is seldom seen in the wild. However, it can be found living in mountainous regions. Golem are known to detonate their own body. It uses this explosive force to jump from mountain to mountain. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Golem is known to occasionally sleep upside down.[1] It is believed that Golem rocks itself into a deep slumber, similar to a cradle. However, there's a chance a sleeping Golem may roll into anyone nearby it. Hence, its best to stay clear of Golem while it sleeps.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Golem with its head and limbs withdrawn into its shell\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn empty Golem shell\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGolem moments before exploding\n\n\n\n\nForms\nGolem has a regional form: Alolan Golem.\nIn the Alola region, Golem has shorter forearms with two claws. The feet have only two claws as well. Its face attracts iron sand, creating the appearance of a mustache, eyebrows, and a large black beard. Jutting out of the top of its body are two large, black rocks with a smaller rock in between, forming the shape of a cannon. On the inner edge of the larger rocks are three golden dots.\nThe cannon prevents them from easily rolling into a ball like its Kantonian variant. Alolan Golem has a grumpy and stubborn personality. Should anyone make Alolan Golem upset, it will roar with a voice similar to thunder, discharging electricity from its body at the same time. Alolan Golem is capable of firing the small rock by using magnetism. The rock will be electrically charged, creating shocks across the whole area of impact. Numbness and fainting can occur with even a glancing blow. If rocks are not available, it will fire nearby Geodude instead. They can also be found in the Canyon Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated.\nAlolan Golem and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Galvanize as an Ability.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Alolan Golem preparing to fire an Alolan Geodude\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Alolan Golem without iron sand on its face\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nGolem evolves from Graveler and is the final form of Geodude.\nAlolan Golem has a dual-type Rock/Electric regional form.

It was used in a battle against Ash and defeated Bulbasaur before being covered in flames thanks to a combination of Charmander's Flamethrower and Fire Spin. As a result, it had to be returned to its Pok\u00e9 Ball, which wound up being so hot that it burned Chopper's fingers. Golem reappeared in a flashback in Charizard Chills.\nIn The Battle of the Badge, Giovanni used a Golem in his Viridian Gym battle against Gary. It was easily defeated by Nidoking.\nIn The Wayward Wobbuffet, Goneff uses a Golem for his bank robberies. It battled Team Rocket and then Totodile, only to be defeated by Wobbuffet's Counter.\nIn Can't Beat the Heat!, Gary used a Golem in his battle against Ash. It battled Charizard, who was unable to use Seismic Toss on it due to its weight. However, despite that and Charizard being stunned by its Magnitude, Golem was defeated.\nIn A Family That Battles Together Stays Together!, Flint used a Golem against Lola during a feud about what type the Pewter Gym should specialize in. In Grating Spaces!, Golem welcomed Brock home.\nIn Hooked on Onix, multiple Golem were the loyal subjects of an Onix called King Onix.\nIn An Elite Coverup!, Bertha's Golem took on Team Rocket and their armored Carnivine and Seviper.\nIn Bucking the Treasure Trend!, a Golem attacked Ash, his friends, and Buck as they searched for Dandelion Island's treasure. Gible defeated it easily and sent it rolling back into the cave it appeared from.\nIn Meloetta and the Undersea Temple!, a Team Rocket Grunt used a Golem alongside a Rhydon to capture Meloetta, but it was stopped from doing so by Ridley and his Golurk.\nIn A Young Royal Flame Ignites!, the Revengers were shown with an Alolan Golem. It helped Mad Magmar during his Battle Royal by distracting Incineroar.\nIn Sparking Confusion!, an Alolan Golem, alongside a group of Alolan Geodude and Graveler, caused havoc at Wela Volcano Park after their feeding rituals were disrupted by a group of rock hunters. Ash, Kiawe, and Sophocles fought it, until Sophocles's Ride Metang proved to be the more dominant one by getting Golem's iron sand to stick to its face. After its defeat, Metang returned the iron sand. In the end, one of the Hikers who frequent Wela Volcano caught the Golem, who had become fond of them.\n\nMinor appearances\nA Golem appeared in Showdown at Dark City, under the ownership of one of the Trainers at the Kaz Gym.\nIn an image in Who Gets To Keep Togepi, Ash, Misty, and Brock were discussing which Pok\u00e9mon they believed would hatch out of the Egg, with Brock mentioning that he wished it would be a Golem.\nIn the beginning of Mewtwo Strikes Back, Raymond owns a Golem. Alongside his Venomoth and Pinsir, it fought Ash's Pikachu, only for all of them to be defeated with Thunderbolt despite the fact that Golem should've been immune to Electric type moves. In the remake of the movie, Golem is replaced by a Drowzee.\nIn The Fourth Round Rumble, Melissa's Golem was her final Pok\u00e9mon in her battle against Gary.

It could also have been inspired by the tsuchikorobi, a Japanese y\u014dkai known as the 'tumbling monster', for its habit of rolling over travelers and crushing them, as Golem does.\nIt might also be based on tortoises, which are believed to hold the world on their backs in many myths, including the Hindu, Chinese, and Native American mythologies. Its \"shell\" may represent the tectonic plates of Earth. It also resembles septarian nodules, also known as \"turtle stones.\"\nAlolan Golem, like its predecessors, seems to have structures made of piezoelectric crystals or magnetite, a subset of iron ore known for its black crystalline appearance and magnetic properties. The black structure on its back may be derived from an electroshock weapon or a railgun. This iron ore takes shape of a Golem's beard and eyebrows.\n\nName origin\nGolem is literally golem.\nGolonya may be a combination of \u30b4\u30ed\u30f3\u30b4\u30ed\u30f3 goron-goron (onomatopoeia of rolling rocks) and montagna (Italian for mountain).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b4\u30ed\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3 Golonya\n\nFrom \u30b4\u30ed\u30f3\u30b4\u30ed\u30f3 goron-goron and montagna\n\n\n French\n\nGrolem\n\nFrom gros and golem\n\n\n Spanish\n\nGolem\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nGeowaz\n\nFrom geo or Geode and Walze\n\n\n Italian\n\nGolem\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub531\uad6c\ub9ac Ttakguri\n\nFrom \ub531\ub531\ud558\ub2e4 ddakddakhada and \uad6c\ub974\ub2e4 gureuda\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u9686\u9686\u5ca9 L\u00f3ngl\u00f3ngy\u00e1n\n\nFrom \u9686\u9686 l\u00f3ngl\u00f3ng and \u5ca9 y\u00e1n\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u9686\u9686\u5ca9 L\u00f9hngl\u00f9hngng\u00e0ahm*\u6efe\u52d5\u5ca9 Gw\u00e1nduhngng\u00e0ahm*\n\nFrom \u9686\u9686 l\u00f9hngl\u00f9hng and \u5ca9 ng\u00e0ahmFrom \u6efe\u52d5 gw\u00e1nduhng and \u5ca9 ng\u00e0ahm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0917\u094b\u0932\u0947\u092e Golem\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0413\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043c Golem\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e42\u0e01\u0e42\u0e25\u0e40\u0e19\u0e35\u0e22 Kolonia\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nAlolan form\nRegional form\nWeaponry in the Pok\u00e9mon world\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 Tweet by \u3042\u308a\u304c\u3072\u3068\u3057/ArigaHitoshi (@ariga_megamix).
