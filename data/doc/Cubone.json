Two small claws, one on each hand, serve as its thumbs, and one large nail on each foot make up its toes. It has two small spikes on its back and a short tail. On its head, Cubone wears the skull of its dead mother as a helmet. Because of this, much of its actual face has never been seen, except for its triangular, black eyes and a small area surrounding them. The skull has two rounded horns on the top of its head and a tooth-like point on the lower sides. Under the skull, Cubone has a brown snout. The small Cubone survives only through the immense skill it possesses in wielding the bone it carries as a weapon.\nIt is called the Lonely Pok\u00e9mon because of its tendency to keep to itself and avoid social situations, due to the trauma caused by the death of its mother. Cubone will often weep at night in mourning of its mother. When Cubone cries, the skull that it wears on its head vibrates and emits \"a plaintive and mournful sound.\" On the night of a full moon, the cries are said to be especially terrible. Cubone seems to recognize its mother in the full moon, and so it howls with a particular sadness. Its cries attract Mandibuzz, a natural predator. It is said a Cubone will evolve into a Marowak once it comes terms with its mother's death. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Cubone is known to cry while sleeping.[1]It is theorized that Cubone's dreams are about its deceased mother. The dreams Cubone have make it cry, but crying makes it stronger. Cubone lives in rocky areas, usually on mountains or in caves. It also once inhabited the Pok\u00e9mon Tower in Lavender Town where deceased Pok\u00e9mon were buried and mourned.\nCubone and its evolved form, Marowak, are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Bone Club and Bonemerang. Cubone and Marowak are also the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Thick Club item. In Generations II and III, Bone Rush was another one of their signature moves.\n\nEvolution\nCubone evolves into Marowak.\nIn Alola, it evolves into Alolan Marowak.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nCubone\u00a0Ground\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nMarowak\u00a0Ground\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nMarowakAlolan Form\u00a0Fire\u00a0\u00a0Ghost\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Red, Blue, Yellow, FireRed, and LeafGreen: An orphaned Cubone appears in the care of Mr. Fuji.

After being rescued by the player from Team Rocket Hideout, it returns to Pok\u00e9mon Tower, where it helps the player and Trace calm his mother's spirit. Trace later adopts Cubone into his party, motivating himself to become stronger to stop Team Rocket and avenge Marowak.

This is because Cubone's Rock Head is its first Ability, while Alolan Marowak's Rock Head is its Hidden Ability. It shares this trait with Tyrogue and Hitmontop's Ability Steadfast.\nIn the second episode of Pok\u00e9mon Origins, a mother Marowak is shown protecting her child Cubone from Team Rocket. Even though the Marowak is alive, the Cubone is still wearing a skull.\nDespite the Pok\u00e9dex saying that Cubone wears the skull of its dead mother, Cubone are born wearing the skull when hatched from Eggs.\nIn The Official Pok\u00e9mon Handbook: Deluxe Edition, there is no mention of Cubone wearing the skull of its mother. Instead, this is said in Cubone's Pok\u00e9dex entry from this book: \"Cubone uses the bones of ancient Pok\u00e9mon to make armor and crude weapons.\"\nOrigin\nCubone was created out of the thought of how sad it would be for a Pok\u00e9mon to die.[2] In its design, it is reptilian in nature and seems to be loosely based on bipedal dinosaurs. It also could be based on primitive cultures that wore bones for decoration and used them for weapons. The use of its bone as a boomerang and as a weapon at the same time seems to be a reference to the boomerang's original use for hunting in Indigenous Australian cultures.\n\nName origin\nCubone is a combination of cub and bone.[3]\nKarakara may be derived from \u30ab\u30e9\u30ab\u30e9 karakara (onomatopoeia for light clattering), contrasting with the \u30ac\u30e9\u30ac\u30e9 garagara (onomatopoeia for heavy clattering) in Marowak's Japanese name.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30ab\u30e9\u30ab\u30e9 Karakara\n\nFrom \u30ab\u30e9\u30ab\u30e9 karakara\n\n\n French\n\nOsselait\n\nFrom osselet, osselets and dent de lait\n\n\n Spanish\n\nCubone\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nTragosso\n\nFrom tragen, tragisch, and osso\n\n\n Italian\n\nCubone\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ud0d5\uad6c\ub9ac Tangguri\n\nFrom \ud0d5\ud0d5 tangtang or \ud759\ud0d5 heulktang and \ub108\uad6c\ub9ac neoguri\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5361\u62c9\u5361\u62c9 K\u01cel\u0101k\u01cel\u0101*\u53ef\u62c9\u53ef\u62c9 K\u011bl\u0101k\u011bl\u0101*\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5361\u62c9\u5361\u62c9 K\u0101l\u0101aik\u0101l\u0101ai\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Greek\n\n\u039a\u03bf\u03c5\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd Kup\u00f3n\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0915\u094d\u092f\u0942\u092c\u094b\u0928 Cubone\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041a\u044c\u044e\u0431\u043e\u043d K'yubon\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e04\u0e32\u0e23\u0e30\u0e04\u0e32\u0e23\u0e30 Kharakhara\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 Satoshi Tajiri: \"There's also Cubone, who was born from the thought of how sad it would be for a Pok\u00e9mon to die.
