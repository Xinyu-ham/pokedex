It has white, three-pronged fins on the sides of its head and a white bump on its forehead, which is its horn growing. Above its round, white snout are oval, purple eyes.\nDratini's life energy is constantly building so it is always growing, and can reach lengths of over six feet (2 meters). As it grows, it sheds its skin regularly; it hides behind a rapid waterfall during the process to protect itself, since the new skin is soft in texture. The shed skin can be tanned and used to create luxury boots. Dratini has been referred as the \"Mirage Pok\u00e9mon\", because its existence was originally thought to be nothing more than a myth. Dratini was first discovered by a fisherman who spent 10 hours attempting to capture it. A small colony has also been found underwater, further confirming its existence. Dratini live near or in bodies of water with a rapid flow, such as the pools at the bottom of waterfalls. It lives a quiet life underwater, eating any food that sinks down to the bottom.\nAs mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Dratini's sleeping habits used to be a mystery due to how rare it was.[1] However, in recent years, Dratini's sleep styles have been discovered and well documented. This is due to trainers who have obtained Dratini and observed its sleeping habits. The four different sleep styles discovered are called Coiled Sleep, Wriggly Sleep, Uncoiled Sleep, and Atop-Belly Sleep.\nIn Generation II, Dratini and its evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Outrage, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding.\n\nEvolution\nDratini evolves into Dragonair, which evolves into Dragonite.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nDratini\u00a0Dragon\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nDragonair\u00a0Dragon\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nDragonite\u00a0Dragon\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon: Magikarp Jump: A Dratini may appear as part of the \"You're No Magikarp!\" event, being accidentally hooked up while fishing (instead of a Magikarp).\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #147\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nLong considered a mythical Pok\u00e9mon until recently when a small colony was found living underwater.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nThe existence of this mythical Pok\u00e9mon was only recently confirmed by a fisherman who caught one.\n\n\nStadium \n\nEven the young are known to exceed 6' 6\".

Team Rocket wanted to steal it from her, but failed. It evolved into a Dragonair at the end of the episode.\n\nOther\n Dratini Egg (left) in Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series\nDratini debuted in the banned episode EP035, under the protection of the warden of the Safari Zone. By the end of the episode, it turned out that the Dratini the warden met 30 years earlier had evolved into a Dragonair, and was now raising its own child Dratini.\nIn Showdown at the Gates of Warp!, due to Dialga and Palkia's influence, Ash's Dragonite devolved into a Dragonair and then into a Dratini. It was later reverted in the same episode.\n\nMinor appearances\nA Dratini appeared in one of Team Rocket's fantasies in Ditto's Mysterious Mansion.\nA Dratini appeared in Snorlax Snowman.\nA Performer's Dratini appeared in a video in Performing with Fiery Charm!.\nIn Alola to New Adventure!, a Trainer's Dratini was on the Melemele Island beach.\nA Dratini appeared in Pikachu's Exciting Adventure!.\nA Trainer's Dratini appeared in League Offenders and Defenders!.\nIn Battling on the Wing!, a Trainer's Dratini watched the battles during the Manalo Conference.\nIn A Test in Paradise!, Goh and Ash witnessed a Dratini on Dragonite Island shedding its own skin before it started swimming in some water.\n\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nEpisode\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\nSource\n\nEntry\n\n\nEP251\n\nDratini\n\nAsh's Pok\u00e9dex\n\nDratini, the Dragon Pok\u00e9mon. Dratini sheds its skin as it grows, often doing so while hidden behind large powerful waterfalls.\n\n\nIn the manga\n Dratini in Pok\u00e9mon Pocket Monsters\nPok\u00e9mon Adventures\nMain article: Clair's Dratini\nMain article: Lance's Dratini\nDratini debuted in Drat That Dratini! in Viridian Forest. It had been attacking Yellow but was calmed by Red. It later appeared again in a flashback of Yellow's in Bang the Drum, Slowbro.\nLance's Dragonite was once a Dratini, as shown in a flashback in The Legend. It was also revealed to be a Pok\u00e9mon harmed by human industrialization. This motivated Lance to formulate his plot to destroy humanity many years later.\nClair's Dragonair was once a Dratini, as shown in a flashback in The Last Battle II.\nIn The Last Battle XIII, a Dratini was sent to participate in the fight in Ilex Forest.\nIn The Final Battle IV, a Dratini helped Emerald with his disabilities.\n\nPok\u00e9mon + Nobunaga's Ambition ~ Ranse's Color Picture Scroll ~\nA Dratini appeared in PNA6, under the ownership of Ranmaru.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Pocket Monsters\nA Dratini appeared in Lance's Dragonite's fantasy in The Final Battle!! when it was telling a false story about how it met Lance.\nA Dratini appeared in Good-Bye, Pikachu?!, where it took a liking to Pikachu. When Giovanni showed up with Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan, Pikachu decided to protect it. Dratini then evolved into a Dragonair when it noticed that Pikachu got injured by Giovanni's Jolteon and Electabuzz. It evolved again into Dragonite when Clefairy pulled its tail.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Zensho\nIn PZ06, Satoshi found a Dratini while fishing in the Safari Zone. Soon afterwards, he traded it to a Fisherman in exchange for several Water-type Pok\u00e9mon and the Safari Zone Warden's missing dentures.\n\nIn the TCG\nMain article: Dratini (TCG)\nIn the TFG\nOne Dratini figure has been released:\n\nNext Quest: Dratini\nTrivia\nIn early English-language promotional material for Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, Dratini was referred to as \"Dragoon\". Although this word can mean a European military unit that is transported on horseback but fights on foot, the name was probably selected as a combination of dragon and lagoon.\nIn Generation I and Generation II, Dratini and Dragonair can learn Hyper Beam via leveling up, but not via TM. This was fixed in Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire.\nDratini and its evolved forms share their category with Horsea, its evolved forms, Salamence, and Kalosian Goodra. They are all known as the Dragon Pok\u00e9mon.\nDratini was the inspiration for the naming of Hedruris dratini, a species of parasitic nematode.[2][3]\nOrigin\nDratini appears to be based on sea serpents or ryu, traditional Japanese dragons or Chinese dragons who bring good luck. Its constant growth is similar to that of snakes, who grow as long as they live. Additionally, its reclusive nature, aquatic habitat, and the fact that, for a long time, it was considered a myth are reminiscent of the Loch Ness Monster.\n\nName origin\nDratini may be a combination of dragon and teeny, tiny, or mini.\nMiniryu may be a combination of miniature and \u7adc ry\u016b (dragon).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30df\u30cb\u30ea\u30e5\u30a6 Miniryu\n\nFrom miniature and \u7adc ry\u016b\n\n\n French\n\nMinidraco\n\nFrom mini and draco\n\n\n Spanish\n\nDratini\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nDratini\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Italian\n\nDratini\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ubbf8\ub1fd Minyong\n\nFrom miniature and \ub1fd (\u9f8d) nyong\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u8ff7\u4f60\u9f8d / \u8ff7\u4f60\u9f99 M\u00edn\u01d0l\u00f3ng\n\nFrom \u8ff7\u4f60 m\u00edn\u01d0 and \u9f8d / \u9f99 l\u00f3ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u8ff7\u4f60\u9f8d M\u00e0ihn\u00e9ihl\u00f9hng\n\nFrom \u8ff7\u4f60 m\u00e0ihn\u00e9ih and \u9f8d l\u00f9hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0921\u094d\u0930\u091f\u093f\u0928\u0940 Dratini\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0414\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0438 Dratini\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e21\u0e34\u0e19\u0e34\u0e23\u0e34\u0e27 Minirio\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nClair's Dratini\nLance's Dratini\nDragonite (UNITE)\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 A new species of Hedruris (Nematoda: Hedruridae) from freshwater turtles, its life cycle and biogeographic distribution of the genus\n\n\u2191 Tweet from @JHelminthology\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0146: Moltres\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0148: Dragonair\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Dratini_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128528\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monDragon-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Slow experience groupBlue-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 02 Pok\u00e9monWater 1 group Pok\u00e9monDragon group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 300Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became both Special Attack and Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 18 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that run from battle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 16:22.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
