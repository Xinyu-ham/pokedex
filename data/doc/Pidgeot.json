Its glossy plumage is mostly brown with cream-colored underparts and flight feathers. Its head has a decorated crest nearly as long as its body. The center feathers of its crest are yellow, while the outer feathers are red. The fan-like feathers of its tail are red or brown. Its beak and legs are pink, with three forward-facing toes and one backward-facing toe on each foot. Behind each eye is an angular black marking.\nPidgeot's powerful wings can stir up windstorms in just a few flaps, and it may spread its wings to intimidate enemies. This Pok\u00e9mon is capable of flying faster than the speed of sound. Its plumage is often described as beautiful, making it a popular choice for skilled Trainers. Pidgeot typically dwells in temperate forests with thick growth and large trees. It is known to prey on Magikarp, which it can spot from great heights.\nIn Generation III, Feather Dance was its signature move, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding.\n\nForms\nPidgeot can Mega Evolve into Mega Pidgeot.\nPidgeot grows noticeably when it Mega Evolves, developing a larger body and longer, broader wings. Its wingtips and tail feathers are tipped with cyan, and its cream coloring is now white. Its eyes turn magenta and its pupils turn white. Mega Pidgeot has an even more elaborate crest on its head, with a streamer-like magenta plume extending from a mane of yellow feathers. A magenta feather projects from the front of its crest, with a single magenta highlight on the left side. The crest is sensitive to air currents, acting like a large antenna and stabilizing Mega Pidgeot's flight.[1] Additionally, its increased wing power allows it to fly for two weeks without rest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMega Pidgeot\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nPidgeot evolves from Pidgeotto and is the final form of Pidgey.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nPidgey\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPidgeotto\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nPidgeot\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #018\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nWhen hunting, it skims the surface of water at high speed to pick off unwary prey such as Magikarp.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon flies at Mach 2 speed, seeking prey.

In Pallet Party Panic!, the same Spearow Ash had thrown a rock at in the first episode returned with its flock, but it had evolved into a Fearow. The flock attacked Ash, so Pidgeotto evolved into Pidgeot to battle Fearow. After defeating Fearow, Pidgeot left Ash's party to watch over a local flock of Pidgey and Pidgeotto, with Ash promising to come back for it later. In The Rainbow and the Pok\u00e9mon Master!, Ash reunited with Pidgeot as it helped to save Pikachu from Team Rocket and agreed to rejoin his team.\n\nOther\nIn Mewtwo Strikes Back and its remake Mewtwo Strikes Back--Evolution, Corey's Pidgeot was one of the Pok\u00e9mon captured and cloned by Mewtwo. It was referred to as a Pidgeotto in the original's dub due to a dubbing error that was corrected in the remake. The Pidgeot clone was seen again in Mewtwo Returns.\nIn Bound for Trouble, a giant Pidgeot was a resident of Fairchild Island. Its size was due to there being excessive quantities of food on the island. Pidgeot snatched Meowth and Pikachu when they got tethered together.\nIn Fighting Flyer with Fire, Falkner used a Pidgeot in his Gym battle against Ash, where it battled and defeated Pikachu with a single Whirlwind attack.

Its Shiny colors in particular resemble a golden eagle. It also shares some characteristics with various passerine birds such as sparrows, chickadees, waxwings, and wrens. Its colorful crest is somewhat similar to the crests of cockatoos.
