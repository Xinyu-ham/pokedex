The top half is red, while the bottom half is white. Because of its resemblance to Pok\u00e9 Balls, it is thought that it was created when one was exposed to an energy pulse. This is supported by the fact that its components do not occur naturally.\nVoltorb is generally found in power plants and other areas with electric fields where it feeds. It was first discovered in the plant where modern Pok\u00e9 Balls were invented. It has a volatile temperament and will explode if agitated or bumped by the slightest contact. Due to being constantly mistaken as a Pok\u00e9 Ball, Voltorb has reportedly zapped many humans as a result.\n\nForms\nVoltorb has a regional form: Hisuian Voltorb.\nHisuian Voltorb, like its modern counterpart, resemble the Apricorn-made Pok\u00e9 Balls of the time period \u2014 both appear to be made of a grainy, woodlike substance, with a glossy surface and a hole on top. On the inside, Hisuian Voltorb's body contains numerous seeds, but it has been impossible to examine its interior due to it being pitch-black.[1] Hisuian Voltorb has a distinctive red wooden unibrow. Despite its resemblance to a Pok\u00e9 Ball, it can be inferred that Hisuian Voltorb's existence predates the device's invention, as evidenced by the fact that the ancient hero of Hisui legend had an Electrode companion which would become the ancestor of the region's noble Electrode.\nHisuian Voltorb can store electric currents in its belly, which it discharges all at once from its hole. Unlike Kantonian Voltorb, Hisuian Voltorb have friendly and excitable temperaments, which leads them to cluster around people, causing them to be a nuisance when they discharge. It is known to let out a great, uproarious laugh whenever it discharges. There are stories of people temporarily plugging the holes of Hisuian Voltorb to prevent them from discharging before removing them from their settlements.[1] It has been seen in Paldea during the rare Mass outbreak events.\n\nEvolution\nVoltorb evolves into Electrode.\nHisuian Voltorb evolves into Hisuian Electrode.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nVoltorb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nVoltorb\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nElectrode\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHisuian Voltorb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nVoltorbHisuian Form\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Grass\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nElectrodeHisuian Form\u00a0Electric\u00a0\u00a0Grass\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: Three Voltorb appear on the Red Table and give the player points when hit.

The game is similar to Minesweeper and largely focuses on flipping over cards to multiply the coins currently earned. Some cards, however, have Voltorb on them which will cause the player to lose Coins when flipped.\nVoltorb has the lowest base Attack stat of all Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nAccording to Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver: Prima's Official Strategy Guide, Voltorb is the only Pok\u00e9mon recommended for the Disc Catch that is not a Flying type.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet, Voltorb will explode if the player walks too close to it and the Voltorb notices them.\nThe Shadow Voltorb in XD: Gale of Darkness is missable if players lose to Miror B in the first battle when he has the Voltorb in the Cave Pok\u00e9 Spot, as there is not a flag to make it respawn unlike other Shadow Pok\u00e9mon. This will lock the player out of catching Voltorb, and as snagging Shadow Dragonite requires snagging every other Shadow Pok\u00e9mon, the player will be locked out of Dragonite too.\nOrigin\nVoltorb seems to be based upon the concept of a living Pok\u00e9 Ball, and is often mistaken for one. As such, its design is likely inspired by gashapon capsules, which often consists of a white half and a vibrant colored half. The idea of Voltorb and Electrode being mistaken for the standard Pok\u00e9 Balls that represent items is similar to a mimic, a monster archetype commonly found in RPGs. Its Shiny coloration is possibly based on a Great Ball.\nVoltorb may also be based on a ball lightning, as hinted by its spherical shape, type, and explosive behavior. Given its tendency to explode and shape, it also shares similarities with common depictions of bombs. It may also be based on tsukumogami, where items acquire a spirit and come to life on their 100th birthday, which might be referenced by Voltorb's National Pok\u00e9dex number, which is 100.\nThe expression on both Voltorb and Electrode may be a personification of the positive and negative charges associated with electric charge. For their Kantonian forms, Voltorb has a negative angry look, where Electrode has a positive happy look. The polarity of these expressions, or charges, are reversed for their Hisuian forms.\nHisuian Voltorb and its Grass typing may be based on the fact that Pok\u00e9 Balls were originally made from Apricorns, which may be based on Japanese chestnut or acorns. It may also be based on traditional Japanese fireworks: they are spherical in shape, with shells made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, charges inside that are often made with rice husks, and a hole where the fuse goes. The fact that it has numerous seeds inside its body may also be inspired by a seed ball (also known as a seed bomb), which are made by rolling various seeds with clay, forming a ball. The seed ball is then planted or thrown into the ground where vegetation is sparse, so that the seeds will germinate and grow.
