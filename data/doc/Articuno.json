On its forehead is a crest that consists of three, darker blue rhombus-shaped feathers. It has circular red eyes, a short gray beak, and long, thin gray legs. Each foot has three forward-facing digits and one facing backward. On its chest is a mass of white, downy feathers. Its long, streamer-like tail is longer than its body and the same shade of blue as its crest.\nArticuno has the power to control ice at will. When Articuno flaps its wings, it can chill the moisture in the air around it, making snow fall. It flies from icy mountain to icy mountain. According to legend, it appears before doomed travelers lost in icy regions. As seen in Freeze Frame, Articuno sometimes aids travelers and guides them to safety. Articuno lives in cold, isolated locations such as snowy mountains filled with permafrost. Articuno loves Articuno Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered and sang with it in the past.\nShadow Articuno is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Shadow Chill.\n\nForms\nArticuno has a regional form: Galarian Articuno.\n\n Galarian Articuno firing beams from its eyes\nIn Galar, Articuno has a distinct appearance. Its main body has lavender coloration with a black marking covering its chest. Its feet are black with lavender talons. The three feathers of its crest, which are longer, fused, and folded to the back, have the same purple color as its beak and tail. Its eyes glow light blue, appear to be mostly closed, and are surrounded by a black, mask-like facial disc. When Articuno utilizes its psychic power, the entire mask glows the same color as its eyes, as do the white, feather-like blades of condensed psychic power at the edges of its wings.\nGalarian Articuno keeps itself airborne with its psychic power, almost never having to use its wings for this purpose. Instead, the blades on its wings can be used to slice through iron as easily as paper. Its eyes can fire beams of psychic energy that leave its opponents stuck in place as if frozen solid \u2014 this is what earns this Pok\u00e9mon the name of its Kantonian counterpart. It also has the ability to create mirages of itself in order to fool its opponent and escape. Its elegant and refined movements belie a cold and callous personality. It is constantly migrating around the world, but can be found in the Crown Tundra once every few decades, congregating with the other birds at the Dyna Tree to eat its fruits.[1]\nGalarian Articuno is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Freezing Glare.\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team: Articuno resides in Frosty Forest and challenges the player and partner when they trespass. Articuno then accuses the player and partner of causing the snow of the forest to melt. An Absol then appears and convinces Articuno to let the player and partner pass through.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness: Articuno is the guardian of the Icy Flute.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\nIn Japanese, the wording \u300c\u3067\u3093\u305b\u3064\u306e \u308c\u3044\u3068\u3046\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u300d (Legendary Freezing Pok\u00e9mon) is found in the Pok\u00e9dex entry from Pok\u00e9mon Blue and LeafGreen.

He later used it to battle Blue and Red at Silph Co., where it froze both of them. However, Blue's Charizard quickly melted them, allowing Red and Blue to defeat Koga. Articuno was later merged with Zapdos and Moltres into a combination Pok\u00e9mon that was defeated by Red, Blue, and Green, causing it to split up again and freeing the legendary birds.\nGreen later caught Articuno before the Gold, Silver & Crystal arc as a part of overcoming her fear of birds.

They are both known as the Cruel Pok\u00e9mon.\nIn the second episode of Pok\u00e9mon the Series, there is an engraving on a wall in the Viridian City Pok\u00e9mon Center that depicts the legendary birds. Ash mistakes the Articuno engraving as Ho-Oh. While the blue coloration of the stone indicates the Ice type, and the wings and crest feathers are those of Articuno, the multiple tail feathers look nothing like Articuno's tail, being more similar in appearance to those of Ho-Oh.\nIn Red, Blue, and Yellow, as well as FireRed and LeafGreen, there are binoculars in the gate separating Fuchsia City from Route 15, through which Articuno can be seen flying toward the sea. It is still visible in the binoculars even if it is captured or defeated in the Seafoam Islands.\nIn the opening of Spring Fever, Todd points out a tall mountain that is Articuno's home. This mountain is, on the outside, the same as Ice Island, Articuno's home in The Power of One.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness, Articuno is the only one in its trio that cannot be encountered unless the player enters an event password.\nAlso, it is the only Ice Pok\u00e9mon in IQ group C.\nKantonian Articuno is the only Pok\u00e9mon other than Poliwrath (Generation II only) and Smeargle that is able to learn Lock-On or Mind Reader and an OHKO move, being able to learn Mind Reader and Sheer Cold. An Articuno using this combination can be fought in the Battle Subway.\nArticuno's English name was suggested by Bill Giese, who assisted in the naming of many Generation I Pok\u00e9mon.[2]\nArticuno and the other two legendary birds had Australian beetle species named after them: Binburrum articuno, Binburrum zapdos, and Binburrum moltres. The three species were first described in 2020, and were collectively named after the legendary birds to reflect their rarity.[3][4]\nOrigin\nArticuno seems to take inspiration from various mythical birds such as the Persian Simurgh, Huma, and Roc, or the Chinese Fenghuang. Many of these rare birds were said to live on high mountain peaks and are symbols of good fortune. Tales of their benevolence might be the inspiration behind Articuno\u2019s reputation for rescuing people. Anatomically, it is very similar to the white-throated magpie-jay, and its streamer-like tail feathers are similar to the resplendent quetzal.\nAs suggested by the Pok\u00e9dex entries, the three legendary birds appear to be embodiments of seasons, Articuno represents winter, while Zapdos and Moltres represent summer and spring, respectively. Autumn is however unrepresented.\nGalarian Articuno\u2019s facial feathers resemble a mask worn at a masquerade ball as well as some form of protective eyewear such as glasses, goggles, or a visor. Its freezing glare might be a reference to the Cockatrice, a mythical reptile/bird monster that could turn people to stone with its gaze.
