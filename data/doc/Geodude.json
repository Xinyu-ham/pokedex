It has bulging, rocky eyebrows, trapezoidal eyes with brown pupils, and a wide mouth. Its arms are muscular with five-fingered hands. Geodude uses its arms to climb steadily up steep mountain paths. As a result of their physical appearance, Rhyperior sometimes mistake this Pok\u00e9mon for actual boulders and fire them through their hands.\nGeodude is proud of its sturdy body and will bash against others of its kind in a contest of sorts to prove whose body is harder. It will even go as far as to compare itself with other species such as Roggenrola and Carbink. The longer it lives, the more chipped and worn its body becomes. Long-lived Geodude are completely smooth and round and they have a calm demeanor. However, Geodude's heart remains rugged and tough, no matter what. Geodude can be most often found on mountain trails and fields, with a scholar counting about 100 of them on just one route. It will sit still in these areas, which is why it is often mistaken for a rock. It is often stepped on and will sometimes swing its arms in anger when this occurs. When Geodude sleeps deeply, it buries itself halfway into the ground. Once buried, it will not awaken even if someone steps on it. In the morning, Geodude rolls downhill in search of food.\n\nForms\nGeodude has a regional form: Alolan Geodude.\nIn the Alola region, Geodude is made from a magnetic rock with a more silvery appearance. There are areas on Alolan Geodude's body that are especially magnetic and attract iron sand, creating the appearance of black eyebrows and strands of short black hair. Its fingers are fused together, leaving only the thumb and index finger free. Stepping on Alolan Geodude results in an electrical shock and sometimes an angry headbutt. Like regular Geodude, it competes with others by bashing their bodies together. The iron sand sticks to the one with stronger magnetism. The Alolan Golem will fire these Geodude from its back if real rocks are absent. They can also be found in the Canyon Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated.\nAlolan Geodude and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Galvanize as an Ability.\n\nEvolution\nGeodude evolves into Graveler, which evolves into Golem.\nAlolan Geodude has a dual-type Rock/Electric regional form. It evolves into Alolan Graveler, which evolves into Alolan Golem.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nGeodude\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nGeodude\u00a0Rock\u00a0\u00a0Ground\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nGraveler\u00a0Rock\u00a0\u00a0Ground\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nGolem\u00a0Rock\u00a0\u00a0Ground\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlolan Geodude\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nGeodudeAlolan Form\u00a0Rock\u00a0\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nGravelerAlolan Form\u00a0Rock\u00a0\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nGolemAlolan Form\u00a0Rock\u00a0\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #074\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nFound in fields and mountains.

Melee\nGeodude is the final Pok\u00e9 Float to appear. As the Unown float around the top half of the screen, Geodude floats across the bottom with its arms outstretched, providing a solid base for fighting. After it leaves the screen, there will be no Pok\u00e9 Floats on the screen for a few seconds, before Squirtle pops up and restarts the cycle.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nGeodude appears as a Spirit.\n\nTrivia\nIn the Japanese game Pok\u00e9mon Blue, Geodude weighs 2.0\u00a0kg instead of 20.0\u00a0kg (as it does in all other games). This has no mechanical significance, as no game mechanics use weight in the handheld Generation I games.\nGeodude is similar to Roggenrola: both are Rock-type, have Sturdy as one of their Abilities, evolve at level 25, and reach their final forms when traded.\nGeodude's evolutionary line is the only three-stage evolutionary line in which all members have a regional form.\nAlolan Geodude has the lowest base Special Attack stat of all Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nAlolan Geodude and its evolutionary relatives were designed by Hitoshi Ariga.[1]\nBurmy, Wormadam, Mothim, Geodude, Graveler and Golem are the only Pok\u00e9mon in all five Hisui Pok\u00e9dex sublistings.\nOrigin\nGeodude is based on a living rock or boulder, and thus it may be based on a earth elemental creature like golem.\nAlolan Geodude seems to have dark structures made of piezoelectric crystals or magnetite, a subset of iron ore known for its black crystalline appearance and magnetic properties. This iron ore takes shape of Geodude's eyebrows. Its Electric type may also be a pun on thundereggs.\n\nName origin\nGeodude is a combination of geo- (prefix for earth) and dude (slang word for a male person).[2] It may also involve geode (hollow rock with crystals lined inside).\nIsitsubute is a combination of \u77f3 ishi (stone) and \u792b tsubute (throwing stones).[3]\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30a4\u30b7\u30c4\u30d6\u30c6 Isitsubute\n\nFrom \u77f3 ishi and \u792b tsubute\n\n\n French\n\nRacaillou\n\nFrom racaille and caillou\n\n\n Spanish\n\nGeodude\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nKleinstein\n\nFrom klein, Stein, and a pun of Einstein\n\n\n Italian\n\nGeodude\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uaf2c\ub9c8\ub3cc Kkomadol\n\nFrom \uaf2c\ub9c8 kkoma and \ub3cc dol\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5c0f\u62f3\u77f3 Xi\u01ceoqu\u00e1nsh\u00ed\n\nFrom \u5c0f xi\u01ceo, \u62f3 qu\u00e1n, and \u77f3 sh\u00ed\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5c0f\u62f3\u77f3 S\u00eduky\u00f9hnsehk\n\nFrom \u5c0f s\u00edu, \u62f3 ky\u00f9hn, and \u77f3 sehk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u091c\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0921\u0942\u0921 Geodude\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0413\u0435\u043e\u0434\u0443\u0434 Geodud\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e0b\u0e36\u0e1a\u0e39\u0e40\u0e15\u0e30 Ichisuebute\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nBrock's Geodude\nRegional form\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Tweet by \u3042\u308a\u304c\u3072\u3068\u3057/ArigaHitoshi (@ariga_megamix).
