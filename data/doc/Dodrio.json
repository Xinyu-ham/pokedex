Each head has a long, sharp beak and a black V-shaped, feather crest. It has bristly brown feathers covering its head and upper body, while its lower half has a smooth layer of black feathers. Its tail consists of three pale red feathers with lighter tips. Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with feet that have three clawed toes in front and one in back. A male has black necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs.\nEach head has its own working brain and distinct personality. Each head represents and expresses either sorrow, anger, or joy. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate, and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion, it may overthink, which causes it to become immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the three heads will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of them, gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. The strongest of Dodrio's heads and the thickest neck will become the leader and gain primary control of the body. Another form of adaptation that it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous and going near it may result in a severe pecking.\nAlong with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well. This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest. It is especially prone to race vigorously across grassy plains, even in arid seasons with little rainfall. As a result, despite being slower than Doduo, Dodrio can keep running for an even longer time. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Dodrio is known to usually sleep standing up.[1] Each of the three heads taking turns sleeping while one head stays awake. However, should Dodrio become very tired, even the head that remains awake may start to doze off.\n\nEvolution\nDodrio evolves from Doduo.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nDoduo\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nDodrio\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Ranger: Dodrio is Joel's partner Pok\u00e9mon.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #085\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nUses its three brains to execute complex plans.

It is a melee speedster that starts as Doduo, which evolves into Dodrio at level 5.\n\n\nTrivia\n Dodrio flying in Pok\u00e9mon Stadium\nWhile one of its heads is saying something in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon, the others say me too or mine too, but its pre-evolved form's other head will not.\nDodrio is the only Pok\u00e9mon whose National Pok\u00e9dex number is the whole number portion of its weight in kilograms.\nAccording to its Pok\u00e9dex entries, Doduo can run at 60\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h), while Dodrio can only run at nearly 40\u00a0mph (60\u00a0km/h). However, Dodrio's base Speed stat is higher.\nDodrio is featured in the Generation III wireless mini-game, Dodrio Berry Picking, where it is required that players own a Dodrio to be able to play.\nBefore Generation IV, the necks of normal Dodrio were beige (which became the female neck color), while its pre-evolution's necks were black (which became the male neck color).\nDodrio and Doduo are the only Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon consisting of a head and legs.\nOrigin\nDespite its name, Dodrio seems like it has more in common with ostriches than dodos. It also seems to show some similarities to the moa, an extinct flightless bird; and the emu, another flightless bird. It also resembles the kiwi in some ways as well. Its crests also indicate it was based on cassowaries. The triple head might be a biological mutation. It may also draw inspiration from the Buddhist asuras, three-headed demigods whose faces are sometimes said to each embody one of three emotions: joy, anger, and sorrow.
