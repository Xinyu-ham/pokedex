Its body is composed of mostly its belly, as its limbs are comparatively small. Its head is large with small, pointed ears, and two pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw. It has round feet, which both have three claws and a circular brown paw pad, and short arms with five claws on each hand. Snorlax's bulk makes it the heaviest Normal type.\nSnorlax is often found in mountains and forests. It wakes up only to eat, requiring 900\u00a0lbs. (400\u00a0kg) of food per day before returning to its slumber, although it can also eat while it is resting. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. It can even handle thorny plants or Muk's poison. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pok\u00e9mon bounce on its large stomach. Despite its apparent laziness, however, Snorlax can exhibit tremendous power when prompted. Snorlax is known to appear without warning in villages and steal their food supplies, such as rice granaries, which has long been considered a disaster whenever it happens. Professor Neroli does research on Snorlax, particularly on their ability to attract Pok\u00e9mon around them to sleep. A lot of Pok\u00e9mon tend to gather around Snorlax to sleep near it or on it.\nSnorlax is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake.\n\nForms\n Gigantamax Snorlax attacking\nSnorlax has a Gigantamax form.\nAs Gigantamax Snorlax, seeds and small pebbles that were tangled in its belly fur go through immense growth, causing patches of grass, bushes, rocks, and a large tree to sprout upon its belly. The tree has three red clouds circling it. The Berries that grow on Gigantamax Snorlax's tree include a Sitrus Berry, a Magost Berry, and a Haban Berry.\nGigantamax Snorlax almost never moves; even when in battle it only slightly lifts its body and attacks by flailing with its arms and legs. However, its attacks are very powerful \u2014 Gigantamax Snorlax is considered to be one of the strongest Dynamax Pok\u00e9mon to have been discovered.[1]\nGigantamax Snorlax is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Replenish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGigantamax Snorlax\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nSnorlax evolves from Munchlax.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nMunchlax\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nSnorlax\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Ranger: Snorlax will be seen sleeping throughout the game, effectively cutting off certain areas until later on.

It eats more than 900 lb. of food every day. Most of the time not spent eating is spent sleeping. That big, round body comes in handy when it's brought onto a Smash Bros. battlefield\u2014the Body Slam attack will send anyone who gets hit flying into the air!\nPAL: Snorlax is often referred to as the Sleeping Pok\u00e9mon, and there's a good reason for that!

In this game, it soars into the air and uses its Body Slam attack, smacking into fighters like a giant wrecking ball.\n\n\nSuper Smash Bros.

Silver, the message \"SNORLAX is feeling very eager\" will appear. This is due to Red, who is also at Mt. Silver, owning a Snorlax as well. While the player is on Mt. Silver, unique messages will also appear if the player interacts with a walking Pikachu or Charizard.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver, Snorlax is programmed to be able to learn Charm through breeding, but no other Pok\u00e9mon in the Monster Group can legitimately learn it to pass down as an Egg Move in those games. In Generation III on, Snorlax can inherit the move from Bulbasaur by chain breeding.\nSnorlax's evolutionary line is the only one to have all of its members appear from a Pok\u00e9 Ball within a single Super Smash Bros. game.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver, Snorlax is the only Pok\u00e9mon to receive a +40 catch rate modifier when a Heavy Ball is used.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Crystal, a bug causes the capture formula for the Heavy Ball to incorrectly retrieve the weights of Kadabra, Tauros, and Sunflora, so they also get a +40 catch rate modifier.\nSnorlax is the only black Pok\u00e9mon introduced in Generation I.\nSnorlax is tied with Gengar for the most Pok\u00e9dex entries in Pok\u00e9mon the Series, with a total of 7.\nSnorlax is the subject of a campaign known as Project Snorlax, which was launched by The Pok\u00e9mon Company on March 17, 2023.\nSnorlax's English name was suggested by Bill Giese, who assisted in the naming of many Generation I Pok\u00e9mon.[2]\nConcept and development\nSnorlax was designed by Ken Sugimori.[3]\n\nOrigin\nSnorlax's appearance and behavior of constantly eating and sleeping were directly inspired by Game Freak planner K\u014dji Nishino.[4][5] Additionally, Snorlax may be loosely based on hibernating bears or teddy bears. It may also be based on a food coma, as it eats large quantities of food, then takes a nap, both of which are symptomatic of the condition. Snorlax's Gigantamax form resembles a small hill.\n\nName origin\nSnorlax is a combination of snore and lax or lackadaisical. It was reportedly derived from Esquilax, the name of a nonexistent medieval creature described in The Simpsons episode \"Lisa's Wedding\".[2] Snorlax may also involve relax.[6]\nKabigon is derived from Kirby (Japanese: \u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3 K\u0101b\u012b), the eponymous main character of Nintendo's Kirby video game series. In an interview with Game Informer, Junichi Masuda stated that K\u014dji Nishino, the main inspiration for Snorlax, used to be called \"Kirby\" during the development of Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green because of his large appetite.[5] Kabigon may also involve \u9ef4 kabi (mold), noting the fact that Snorlax will eat anything, even moldy food.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30ab\u30d3\u30b4\u30f3 Kabigon\n\nFrom Kirby[5] and possibly \u9ef4 kabi\n\n\n French\n\nRonflex\n\nFrom ronfler and flexible[7]\n\n\n Spanish\n\nSnorlax\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nRelaxo\n\nFrom relax\n\n\n Italian\n\nSnorlax\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc7a0\ub9cc\ubcf4 Jammanbo\n\nFrom \uc7a0\ub9cc jamman, \uc7a0\ubcf4 jambo, and \uba39\ubcf4 meokbo\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5361\u6bd4\u7378 / \u5361\u6bd4\u517d K\u01ceb\u01d0sh\u00f2u\n\nFrom \u5361\u6bd4 K\u01ceb\u01d0 and \u7378 / \u517d  sh\u00f2u\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5361\u6bd4\u7378 K\u0101beisau\n\nFrom \u5361\u6bd4 K\u0101bei and \u7378 sau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Greek\n\n\u03a3\u03bd\u03cc\u03c1\u03bb\u03b1\u03be Sn\u00f3rlax\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05e1\u05e0\u05d5\u05e8\u05dc\u05e7\u05e1 Snorlax\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0938\u094d\u0928\u094b\u0930\u0932\u0948\u0915\u094d\u0938 Snorlax\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0421\u043d\u043e\u0440\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0441 Snorlaks\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e04\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e34\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e19 Khabikon\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nAsh's Snorlax\nSnor\nSnorlax (UNITE)\nGigantamax\nSnorlax (Sleep)\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Gigantamax Snorlax | Official Website | Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 Dockery, Daniel (October 4, 2022).
