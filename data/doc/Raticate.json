Although it is often depicted on its hind legs, it is a quadruped. It is primarily tawny-colored with a cream underside. It has narrow black eyes, ears with ragged edges and dark insides, and large incisors that grow constantly. There are three whiskers on each side of its face, which it uses to maintain balance. It has short arms with three-fingered hands and webbed feet with three toes. The webbing on its feet allows it to swim. Its tail is long and scaly. Females will have shorter whiskers.\nIf attacked, Raticate stands up on its hind legs, bares its fangs and shrieks in an intimidating manner at its enemy. It is willing to take on larger foes if provoked enough. Its teeth are strong enough to gnaw through steel and their constant growth means it often needs to gnaw on something, like rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses, and is capable of chewing through cinderblocks and toppling concrete buildings. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Raticate is known to sleep with a log in its teeth, gnawing at it in the process. [1]. This Pok\u00e9mon typically lives in plains and savannas.\nPrior to Generation IV, Raticate and its pre-evolved form, Rattata, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Hyper Fang and Super Fang.\n\nForms\nRaticate has a regional form: Alolan Raticate.\nIn Alola, Raticate has become heavier and darker due to its urban environment and higher calorie diet.[2] Its fur is mostly black with a brown, leaf-shaped patch on its belly and brown inside its ears. Its hands, feet, cheeks, and tail are a whitish-cream color, and its hands are much smaller. It has large, puffy cheeks with four whiskers under its chin and two sprouting sideways from the top of each cheek. Its large incisors are still visible, but its eyes are now red.\nThis variant uses its nest as a food stockpile, and generally prefers to have the Alolan Rattata it commands to go out and forage for food while it remains in its nest and eats. It is selective in what it eats, however, only eating fresh, high-quality foods, such as fruits. Rumor has it that a certain high-class restaurant even exploits this selectivity, bringing Raticate along to buy ingredients and letting it taste test new dishes. Each Alolan Raticate has its own territory, and disputes over food and feeding grounds happen frequently. Alolan Raticate and Rattata are not native to Alola, having been brought to the region via cargo ships. Their populations grew drastically until Yungoos and Gumshoos were imported as a control measure.\n\nTotem Pok\u00e9mon\nA special Alolan Raticate in Alola acts as the Totem Pok\u00e9mon for Ilima's trial in Verdant Cavern. This Raticate possesses Z-Power, an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Raticate and completing the trial is a Normalium Z (in Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon, it is a Darkinium Z instead).\n\nEvolution\nRaticate evolves from Rattata.\nAlolan Raticate evolves from Alolan Rattata.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nRaticate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nRattata\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nRaticate\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlolan Raticate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nRattataAlolan Form\u00a0Dark\u00a0\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nRaticateAlolan Form\u00a0Dark\u00a0\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #020\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nIt uses its whiskers to maintain its balance.

This was changed to 127 in Generation III.\nRaticate is the only Pok\u00e9mon that shares its National Pok\u00e9dex number with the level at which it evolves from its pre-evolved form.\nRaticate and its pre-evolved form both share their category with Pikachu, Raichu, Sandshrew, Sandslash, Pawmi, and Pawmo. They are all known as the Mouse Pok\u00e9mon, though Rattata and Raticate were originally called the Rat Pok\u00e9mon prior to Generation III.\nOf all the Totem Pok\u00e9mon that can be battled in Alola, Totem Raticate is one of the only two Totem Pok\u00e9mon that is battled in only one game out of the two versions \u2014 in this case, Moon and Ultra Moon. The other is Totem Gumshoos.\nDuring the cutscene before Totem Raticate's battle, it cries out Gumshoos's cry instead of its own cry.\nAlolan Raticate and its pre-evolution are the only regional forms that cannot be transferred out of Pok\u00e9mon HOME into any Generation VIII or IX game.\nDesign variations\nIn its sprites and artwork for Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green and Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue, Raticate originally had four fingers on its front paws instead of three.\n\n\n\n\n\nRed and Green art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed and Blue art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey art\n\n\n\n\nOrigin\nRaticate appears to be based on a rat, as well as a semi-aquatic rodent such as a muskrat or a coypu due to its large size and webbed feet. Its scruffy ears are similar to a guinea pig.\nAlolan Raticate appears to be based on the black rat, brown rat, or Polynesian rat, all of which are invasive species in Hawaii. Their attacks on sugar cane fields caused the locals to import the small Indian mongoose into Hawaii as a form of pest control, explaining the relationship between Yungoos/Gumshoos and Rattata/Raticate. Its gluttonous behavior, ability to command groups of Rattata to steal, and hostile relationship with the detective-inspired Gumshoos are reminiscent of a stereotypical crime boss. It has cheek pouches similar to chipmunks and hamsters.\n\nName origin\nRaticate may be a combination of rat and eradicate (to destroy or exterminate) or masticate (to chew).\nRatta may be derived from \u30e9\u30c3\u30c8 ratto (rat).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30e9\u30c3\u30bf Ratta\n\nFrom \u30e9\u30c3\u30c8 ratto\n\n\n French\n\nRattatac\n\nFrom rat and attaque\n\n\n Spanish\n\nRaticate\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nRattikarl\n\nFrom Ratte and radikal\n\n\n Italian\n\nRaticate\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub808\ud2b8\ub77c Retra\n\nFrom rat and ultra\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u62c9\u9054 / \u62c9\u8fbe L\u0101d\u00e1\n\nTranscription of its Japanese name\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u62c9\u9054 L\u0101aidaaht*\u54e5\u9054 G\u014ddaaht*\n\nTranscription of its Japanese namePartial transcription of \u30b3\u30e9\u30c3\u30bf Koratta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05e8\u05d8\u05d9\u05e7\u05d9\u05d9\u05d8 Raticate\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0930\u0948\u091f\u093f\u0915\u0947\u091f Raticate\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nRatikeitas\n\nFrom English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0420\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0435\u0439\u0442 Ratikeyt\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e23\u0e31\u0e15\u0e15\u0e32 Ratta\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nAsh's Raticate\nRatty\nTotem Pok\u00e9mon\nRegional form\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Raticate\n\n\nExternal links\n\n Alolan forms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: Regional forms (Alolan \u2022 Galarian \u2022 Hisuian \u2022 Paldean) \u2022 Ecologically similar Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\nTotem Pok\u00e9mon\n\nMelemele Island\nAkala Island\nUla'ula Island\nPoni Island\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0019: Rattata\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0021: Spearow\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Raticate_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4134840\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monNormal-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monDark-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupBrown-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 08 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with different formsField group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Unova Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 413Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with 18 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monShadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XDBlack-colored Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 30 September 2024, at 12:17.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
