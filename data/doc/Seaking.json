It has round, dark eyes, prominent pink lips, two small fangs, and a cream-colored horn in the center of its forehead. A female will have a smaller horn than a male. Most of its body is orange with a patch of white under its mouth and along its underside. There are several black markings on its body: two thick lines under each eye, a large wavy patch on its back, and several speckles near its tail. It has billowing pectoral fins and a pair of tail fins shaped like butterfly wings, all of which are white speckled with black. However, its dorsal fin is pure white and rigid.\nSeaking is a very powerful swimmer that is found in rivers and streams. It can swim not only against a river's current, but up waterfalls as well. In the autumn spawning season, it grows fatter and more vibrant. It travels upriver where male Seaking engage in elaborate dances to court females. The female would go for the Seaking with the most graceful dance.\nSeaking uses its powerful horn to bore holes in riverbed boulders in order to shelter its Eggs from water currents. A mated pair take turns patrolling around their new nest for roughly a month and defend it with their lives. There are two different groups of Trainers who are obsessed with Seaking's horns or dorsal fins. However, the groups cannot get along with each other. In Generation I, Waterfall was its signature move.\n\nEvolution\nSeaking evolves from Goldeen.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nGoldeen\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nSeaking\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #119\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nIn the autumn spawning season, they can be seen swimming powerfully up rivers and creeks.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nIt is the male's job to make a nest by carving out boulders in a stream using the horn on its head.\n\n\nStadium \n\nIn the autumn, they travel up rivers to spawn.

Seaking is the evolved form of Goldeen.

However, the game programmers made an error and filled the third data slot with Tail Whip, so Seaking ended up with two starting moves instead.\nOrigin\nSeaking seems to be based on the oranda breed of goldfish due to its plump body and billowing tail, specifically the azuma nishiki variety. It might also be inspired by the Sanke variety of koi fish. Its behavior is reminiscent of the sockeye salmon, whose bodies flush red as they swim upstream and climb waterfalls during their breeding season. Its horn may be a reference to Matsya, a giant horned fish that is one of the avatars assumed by the Hindu deity Vishnu. Seaking's royal theme may come from the Japanese word for goldfish which is \u91d1\u9b5a Kingyo.\n\nName origin\nSeaking may be a combination of sea, king, and possibly a play on seeking.\nAzumao may be derived from \u6771\u9326 azuma nishiki (a breed of goldfish) and \u738b \u014d (king).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30a2\u30ba\u30de\u30aa\u30a6 Azumao\n\nFrom \u6771\u9326 azuma nishiki and \u738b \u014d\n\n\n French\n\nPoissoroy\n\nFrom poisson and roy\n\n\n Spanish\n\nSeaking\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nGolking\n\nFrom Goldfisch and king\n\n\n Italian\n\nSeaking\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc655\ucf58\uce58 Wangkonchi\n\nFrom \uc655 (\u738b) wang and \ucf58\uce58 Konchi\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u91d1\u9b5a\u738b / \u91d1\u9c7c\u738b J\u012bny\u00faw\u00e1ng\n\nFrom \u91d1\u9b5a / \u91d1\u9c7c j\u012bny\u00fa and \u738b w\u00e1ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u91d1\u9b5a\u738b G\u0101my\u00f9hw\u00f2hng\n\nFrom \u91d1\u9b5a g\u0101my\u00f9h and \u738b w\u00f2hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0938\u0940\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0917 Seaking\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Icelandic\n\nS\u00e6konungur*\n\nFrom sea and konungur\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0421\u0438\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0433 Siking\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e2d\u0e0b\u0e36\u0e21\u0e32\u0e42\u0e2d Asuemao\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0118: Goldeen\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0120: Staryu\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Seaking_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128471\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monWater-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupRed-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 03 Pok\u00e9monWater 2 group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hoenn Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Sinnoh Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 450Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 17 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that learn HM moves by level-up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 16:22.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
