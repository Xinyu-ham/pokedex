It has a small head with pure white eyes and a segmented body that is mostly hidden by the mushroom. It has three pairs of legs with the foremost pair forming large pincers. The fungus growing on its back has a large red cap with yellow spots throughout.\nThe insect has been drained of nutrients and is now under the control of the fully-grown tochukaso. Removing the mushroom will cause Parasect to stop moving. It can thrive in dark forests with a suitable amount of humidity for growing fungi. Swarms of this Pok\u00e9mon have been known to infest trees. The swarm will drain the tree of nutrients until it dies and will then move on to a new tree. It has been known to fight with Shiinotic over territory. Prior to Generation III, Spore was its signature move.\n\nEvolution\nParasect evolves from Paras.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nParas\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Grass\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nParasect\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Grass\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #047\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nA host-parasite pair in which the parasite mushroom has taken over the host bug.

She uses it extensively in her Pok\u00e9mon catching, using its Spore attack to put targets to sleep. Parasect is capable of increasing the radius of its Spore attack to at least 3 kilometers. In Lively Larvitar, the origin of Crystal's Parasect is revealed: it, along with Crystal's Natu, Hitmonchan, and Cubone, were wild Pok\u00e9mon living in Mt. Mortar and had fought with a local Arcanine that had gone berserk from a severe eye injury. Parasect was able to create medicinal spores to help Arcanine heal and Crystal recover from her fractured arms.

They are all known as the Mushroom Pok\u00e9mon.\nAll six Pok\u00e9mon also share a common move, Spore; and Ability, Effect Spore.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon GO, they all give more Stardust than most other Pok\u00e9mon upon capture.\nParasect can be seen as a counterpart to Shiinotic. Both share the Grass type, the same base stat total of 405, evolve at Level 24, both are mushroom-based Pok\u00e9mon and thus can learn Spore, and both appeared as trial Pok\u00e9mon of the Lush Jungle in Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon depending on the game version, with Parasect being found in Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Shiinotic in Pok\u00e9mon Moon.\nOrigin\n  Bulbanews has an article related to this subject: On the Origin of Species: Paras and Parasect  \nParasect resembles a cicada nymph. It may also be based on a hermit crab with a mushroom for a shell. In concept, it could be inspired by ants that are infected with mushroom spores that take control of the host ant's brain and sprout from its head or back.\nThe fungus on Parasect is identified as tochukaso. Tochukaso is the Japanese name of the real-world fungus Ophiocordyceps sinensis, an endoparasitoid that replaces the host tissue and can affect its behavior. It may also draw inspiration from Massospora, a genus of fungi which include species that specifically infect cicadas.\n\nName origin\nParasect may be a combination of parasite and insect.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30d1\u30e9\u30bb\u30af\u30c8 Parasect\n\nFrom parasite and insect\n\n\n French\n\nParasect\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Spanish\n\nParasect\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n German\n\nParasek\n\nFrom Parasit and Insekt\n\n\n Italian\n\nParasect\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ud30c\ub77c\uc139\ud2b8 Parasect\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u6d3e\u62c9\u65af\u7279 P\u00e0il\u0101s\u012bt\u00e8\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u6d3e\u62c9\u65af\u7279 P\u0101ail\u0101ais\u012bdahk*\u5de8\u83c7\u87f2 Geuihg\u016bch\u00f9hng*\n\nMandarin-based transcription of Japanese nameFrom \u5de8 geui, \u8611\u83c7 m\u00f2hg\u016b, and \u87f2 ch\u00f9hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092a\u0948\u0930\u093e\u0938\u0947\u0915\u094d\u091f Parasect\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Icelandic\n\nSn\u00edkjupadda*\n\nFrom sn\u00edkjud\u00fdr and padda\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nParasektas\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0442 Parasekt\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e47\u0e04\u0e17\u0e4c Pharasek\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0046: Paras\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0048: Venonat\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Parasect_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128526\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monBug-type Pok\u00e9monGrass-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupRed-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 14 Pok\u00e9monBug group Pok\u00e9monGrass group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hisui Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 405Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 19 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 16:22.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
