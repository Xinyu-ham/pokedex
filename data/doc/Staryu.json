These appendages surround an exterior organ called the core. The core resembles a golden metal casing with a red gem in the center, which is held in place by a golden ring looped around Staryu's lower left point. If any of Staryu's appendages are lost or eaten by predators like Lumineon, it is unharmed and can grow them back with ease provided the core is still intact.\nWhen the sun goes down, Staryu's core glows its brightest. Many Staryu will float from the seafloor to the surface and align themselves with stars of the night sky as their core flickers, displaying a connection with the celestial bodies of space. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Bye Bye Psyduck, it is shown that if Staryu becomes weak, its core will grow faint and flash slowly. During the ends of summer, groups of Staryu tend to gather while lighting up in a steady rhythm. Staryu can be found at the very bottom of the ocean on the seafloors. There are times, however, when Staryu finds itself in rivers that lead into the ocean as seen in Pok\u00e9mon Snap. In Generation III, Camouflage was its signature move.\nIn the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, and the original Japanese version of the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Water Flowers of Cerulean City, Staryu is classified as hermaphroditic.\n\nEvolution\nStaryu evolves into Starmie.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nStaryu\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nStarmie\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: A Staryu appears on the Red Table; however, it is merely decoration.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #120\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nAn enigmatic Pok\u00e9mon that can effortlessly regenerate any appendage it loses in battle.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nAs long as the center section is unharmed, it can grow back fully even if it is chopped to bits.\n\n\nStadium \n\nIt is capable of growing back any portion of its body that is cut off.

Melee/Brawl/3DS/Wii U/Ultimate\nWhen released from a Pok\u00e9 Ball, Staryu will target one of the opponents, spin towards them, and shoot Swift. Its attack is rapid-fire, but it can easily be escaped from by Directional Influence; the player can still move around while getting hit by Swift. In Ultimate, it appears as a Spirit.\n\nMelee trophy information\nThese starshape Pok\u00e9mon that evolve into Starmie are found in large numbers at the seashore. At night, Staryu's red center glows and blinks on and off. It's said that as long as its red center remains, it can regrow its limbs. Whether it's related to Cleffa, another Pok\u00e9mon with a vaguely star-shaped appearance, is unknown.\n\nBrawl trophy information\n\"A Star Shape Pok\u00e9mon. It gathers in groups and flashes the red jewel in the center of its body in time to the twinkling of the stars in the night sky. If it loses appendages, it can regenerate them right away. It can also use Camouflage, which allows it to change its type to match the surrounding terrain. If a Water Stone is used on it, evolves into Starmie.\"\n\n\n3DS/Wii U Trophy information\n Staryu trophy in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS\nNA: This Water-type Pok\u00e9mon, Staryu, greatly resembles a star. Exposing one to a Water Stone causes it to evolve into Starmie. Another star-shaped Pok\u00e9mon, Cleffa, exists, but the two don't look all that similar. In Smash Bros., Staryu will attack foes with Swift. Anyone hit will be seeing stars! \nPAL: This Water-type Pok\u00e9mon evolves into Starmie when you use a Water Stone. Its star shape makes it rather cute, but that doesn't mean Staryu's not a threat. Its Swift attack will pummel fighters with a flurry of stars. If you notice Staryu's aiming at you, quickly move up or down to get out of the line of fire. \n\n\nTrivia\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Ranger, Staryu is the only Pok\u00e9mon with the Field Move Flash.\nOnce Staryu serves its purpose with Flash, it cannot be captured again, except during the Kyogre mission.\nStaryu is one of fourteen Pok\u00e9mon that one is able to collect foreign Pok\u00e9dex entries for in Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl.\nStaryu shares its category name with Cleffa. They are both known as the Star Shape Pok\u00e9mon.\nStaryu was programmed to learn Egg moves in Gold and Silver, but these moves were unobtainable because both Staryu and Starmie are gender unknown and so could only breed with Ditto. These moves were removed in Crystal.\nStaryu, Starmie, and Mew are the only Pok\u00e9mon species that are gender unknown but can legitimately learn Attract in Generation II. This move has no effect when used by these Pok\u00e9mon.\nStaryu may be considered a counterpart of Shellder. Both are Water-types in the Water 3 Egg Group, both evolve with a Water Stone, and both gain a second type upon evolution. Cloyster is seen as a slow defensive Pok\u00e9mon, while Starmie is seen as a fast attacking Pok\u00e9mon.\nThey also have a chance of holding valuable items, Stardust/Star Piece and Pearl/Big Pearl, respectively. Staryu is exclusive to LeafGreen and X, while Shellder is exclusive to FireRed and Y, with both Pok\u00e9mon found by fishing in the same locations in their respective versions.\nStarfishes and oysters are natural enemies, as starfishes prey on oysters.\nPok\u00e9Park 2: Wonders Beyond erroneously refers to Staryu as a male, despite it being a Pok\u00e9mon species that is gender unknown.\nOrigin\nStaryu seems to be based on a stylized starfish such as the common starfish, or the necklace starfish with its vivid red center surrounded by bright plates. Like Staryu, many real starfish have the ability to regenerate lost body parts. Given its ties to outer space and ability to emit light, it may also be based on literal stars and meteors. It is also reminiscent of ornate jewelry, with its central core resembling a polished cabochon gem mounted inside a golden prong setting. The standard color of its gem resembles a ruby, while its Shiny color resembles a sapphire. Its tendency to rapidly spin its body is reminiscent of shuriken and propellers.\nStaryu's gender unknown designation may be based on hermaphroditism, observed in some real-life starfish species. In the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia and the original Japanese version of the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Water Flowers of Cerulean City, Staryu is classified as hermaphroditic.\nAdditionally, Staryu's ties to outer space, its Japanese name, its ability to learn various beam attacks, and the gem in its middle acting like a heart may all be a reference to the Ultraman series, where Ultra Warriors have similar gems on their chests that start flashing when they are weak, just like Staryu's gem as shown in Pok\u00e9mon the Series.\n\nName origin\nStaryu may be a combination of star and you (in opposition to the me in Starmie).\nHitodeman may be a combination of \u6d77\u661f hitode (starfish) and man (possibly in reference to Ultraman).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30d2\u30c8\u30c7\u30de\u30f3 Hitodeman\n\nFrom \u6d77\u661f hitode and man\n\n\n French\n\nStari\n\nFrom star\n\n\n Spanish\n\nStaryu\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nSterndu\n\nFrom Stern and du\n\n\n Italian\n\nStaryu\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ubcc4\uac00\uc0ac\ub9ac Byulgasari\n\nFrom \ubcc4 byeol and \ubd88\uac00\uc0ac\ub9ac bulgasari\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u6d77\u661f\u661f H\u01ceix\u012bngx\u012bng\n\nFrom \u6d77\u661f h\u01ceix\u012bng and \u661f\u661f x\u012bngx\u012bng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u6d77\u661f\u661f H\u00f3is\u012bngs\u012bng\n\nFrom \u6d77\u661f h\u00f3is\u012bng and \u661f\u661f s\u012bngs\u012bng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05e1\u05d8\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d5 Staryu\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0938\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0930\u092f\u0942 Staryu\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044c\u044e Star'yu\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e2e\u0e34\u0e42\u0e15\u0e40\u0e14\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19 Hitodeman\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nMisty's Staryu\nMisty's Starmie\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Smash Bros. series\n\n\nGames:\n\nSuper Smash Bros. \u2022 Super Smash Bros.
