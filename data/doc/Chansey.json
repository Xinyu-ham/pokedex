It has tiny eyes and three hair-like growths on each side of its head. The tufts of hair have dark pink tips. On the center of its belly is a dark pink pouch that contains a single white egg. The egg is said to be very nutritious and it lays several new ones every day. Finally, it has a short tail. Chansey is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\nA kindhearted Pok\u00e9mon, Chansey will share its eggs with injured people and Pok\u00e9mon. However, Chansey will never share its egg to those with evil hearts. The eggs become more delicious if Chansey is raised with love and care. Chansey's egg is used as a high-class cooking ingredient due to the nutrition it has. As a result, Chansey have been referred to as doctors' doubles because of its eggs. Due to its egg being over-harvested, Chansey is extremely rare in the wild and is said to bring good luck and happiness to those who manage to catch it. Fleeing from those seeking its egg has made this once-slow species much quicker on its feet than in the past. It is more commonly found in urban settings. Chansey is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Lucky Punch item. In Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus, if the player is injured, any nearby Chansey will come to check them out, and then flee when they're fully healed. They don't actually heal the player, however.\nChansey and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Soft-Boiled by leveling up.\n\nEvolution\nChansey evolves from Happiny and evolves into Blissey.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nHappiny\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nChansey\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nBlissey\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Yellow & Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!: Chansey appear in Pok\u00e9mon Centers.\nPok\u00e9mon Stadium 2: Chansey stars in the mini-game \"Egg Emergency\".

Chansey cannot evolve into Blissey in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen before the player obtains the National Pok\u00e9dex, as the evolution will be interrupted. Chansey also cannot evolve into Blissey in Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, as Blissey is not present in those games.

Building in Saffron City, and can also be released from a Pok\u00e9 Ball in which case she will shoot out eggs.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Melee\nWhen released from a Pok\u00e9 Ball, Chansey will use Soft-Boiled and produce five eggs. Anyone can pick them up and they will either slightly heal the holder or contain items. If attacked, Chansey can be knocked away, stopping egg production.\nChansey is also a Pok\u00e9float. The float will quickly bob up and down from the bottom of the screen four times.\n\nTrophy information\n\"Renowned for its kind temperament, Chansey has been known to offer injured creatures a highly nutritious egg to aid their recovery. Legend has it that this charitable creature brings friendship to anyone who captures a Chansey. All Chansey are female, and every now and then one is found in possession of a Lucky Egg.\"\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nChansey appears as a Spirit and as a stage hazard in the retuning Saffron City stage\n\nTrivia\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue beta, Chansey was originally known as \"Lucky\", which also happens to be its romanized Japanese name.\nChansey shares its category name with Exeggcute. They are both known as the Egg Pok\u00e9mon.\nChansey received the biggest decrease to its Special stats in Generation II, losing 70 points of its Special Attack stat.\nChansey's HP increase is the largest single stat increase after evolving from Happiny, at 150 points.\nChansey is tied with Happiny for the lowest base Attack and Defense stats of all Pok\u00e9mon, both at five.\nChansey's HP is the highest base stat to base stat total ratio. Its HP stat of 250 makes up approximately 55.6% of its base stat total.\nChansey, Porygon2, and Dipplin are the only non-fully evolved Pok\u00e9mon that evolve from another Pok\u00e9mon through the use of an item.\nOrigin\nChansey's names, the fact that it shares nutritious eggs, is very rare and runs very quickly suggest it may be based on literal luck and its elusiveness. It also serves the typical RPG game role of a medic.\nChansey's tendency to carry eggs in a pouch is very reminiscent of a monotreme (mainly the echidnas) or marsupial, but it may also simply be based on a general concept of females and motherhood. As the Pok\u00e9dex mentions its frequent laying of nutritious eggs, Chansey may also be based on chickens or other poultry, and its \"ears\" give it the semblance of an axolotl.\n\nName origin\nChansey may be from either chance or chancy.\nLucky is literally lucky.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc Lucky\n\nFrom lucky\n\n\n French\n\nLeveinard\n\nFrom le veinard\n\n\n Spanish\n\nChansey\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nChaneira\n\nFrom Chance, Ei, and rar\n\n\n Italian\n\nChansey\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub7ed\ud0a4 Lucki\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5409\u5229\u86cb J\u00edl\u00ecd\u00e0n\n\nFrom \u5409\u5229 j\u00edl\u00ec and \u86cb d\u00e0n\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5409\u5229\u86cb G\u0101tleihdaahn\n\nFrom \u5409\u5229 g\u0101tleih and \u86cb d\u00e1an\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05e6'\u05e0\u05e1\u05d9 Chensi\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u091a\u0948\u0902\u0938\u0940 Chansey\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0427\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0438 Chensi\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e25\u0e31\u0e04\u0e01\u0e35 Lakki\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nNurse Joy's Chansey\nNurse Joy's Blissey\nChansey (MPJ)\nBrock's Chansey\nBlissey (UNITE)\nMollie's Chansey\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Smash Bros. series\n\n\nGames:\n\nSuper Smash Bros. \u2022 Super Smash Bros.
