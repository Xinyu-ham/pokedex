Its body is primarily green and has a thin, cream-colored section between its head, thorax, and abdomen. Female Scyther have larger abdomens than male Scyther. Its reptilian head has two narrow, triangular eyes and three blunt horns extending from its forehead. Its arms end in large, white scythes, which it uses for both hunting and fighting. Two pairs of cream-colored wings extend from its back. While these wings do allow Scyther to fly, it rarely does so. Scyther's thighs have large, upward-pointing spikes. Its feet are tall, rounded, and conical, almost extending to its thighs; each foot ends in three small, white claws on its front side.\nScyther is an adept hunter that tears at its prey with its scythes. Thanks to its green coloration, it can camouflage itself well in the grasslands and forests where it lives. Humans rarely encounter wild Scyther in these areas, however. Said to be like a ninja, Scyther can move so quickly that it cannot be followed, increasing the effectiveness of its scythes. It maintains the sharpness of its blades through battle as well as by cutting through hard objects, such as trees; it can cut down a massive tree with just a single slice, although it cannot penetrate Tarountula's elastic threads. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Tracey Gets Bugged showed that wild Scyther form swarms with a single leader chosen through combat. When a challenger successfully defeats a current leader and replaces it, the defeated leader is exiled from the swarm. In Showdown at Dark City, it was shown that Scyther becomes aggressive when faced with the color red.\n\nEvolution\nScyther evolves into Scizor.\nIn Hisui, it evolves into Kleavor.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nScyther\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nScizor\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nKleavor\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Rock\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Snap: A Scyther appears at two points on the Beach level. At the first point, the use of a Pester Ball will chase it out. (This also triggers a special Multiple Pikachu Photo opportunity.) The second point is close to the end of the Beach level.\nPok\u00e9mon Stadium 2: Scyther stars in a mini-game alongside Pinsir called \"Clear Cut Challenge.\" Each player chops a falling log for each round of the game. The score for each player is determined by how close the player is to the white line on the log. Cutting anywhere above the log will cause the player to lose points.\nPok\u00e9mon Ranger: Garret uses two Scyther to back up his Scizor.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness: Scyther is one of the members of Team Razor Wind.

This is a corruption of the word \"strike\", which is also its romanized Japanese name.\nDespite having different base stats, Scyther and its evolved forms all have a base stat total of 500. This makes Scyther the only pre-evolved Pok\u00e9mon to have the same base stat total as its evolved forms.\nScyther can be seen as a parallel to Pinsir. Both of them are Bug-type Generation I Pok\u00e9mon, with base stat totals of 500 and originally no evolutionary line. Scyther is exclusive to Pok\u00e9mon Red, FireRed, Diamond, and Let's Go, Pikachu!, while Pinsir is exclusive to Pok\u00e9mon Blue, LeafGreen, Pearl, and Let's Go, Eevee!.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Platinum, HeartGold and SoulSilver, Scyther can learn Vacuum Wave by leveling up, but not via Move Tutor.\nScyther is the only Pok\u00e9mon with a split evolution to have had both of its evolutions introduced after its debut.\nScyther's evolution into Kleavor is programmed into Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet. However, the Black Augurite needed for evolution is unobtainable, preventing the Pok\u00e9mon from evolving. It shares this trait with Ursaring and Stantler.\nOrigin\nAs indicated by its category, Scyther seems to be based on a mantis \u2014 most closely resembling the European mantis and the Chinese mantis \u2014 with arms shaped like scythes. It also possesses some reptilian characteristics (e.g. head, teeth, claws, bipedal stance) that give it similarities to dromaeosaurid dinosaurs, as well as to therizinosaurids (scythe lizards) due to the shape of its arms. As indicated in its Pok\u00e9dex entries, it may also be based on a ninja. There are similarities to the kamikiri, a haircutting yokai with sharp claws and teeth that may look like an insect.\n\nName origin\nScyther may be a combination of scythe and the suffix -er (something that does an action).\nStrike is literally strike.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af Strike\n\nFrom strike\n\n\n French\n\nIns\u00e9cateur\n\nFrom insecte and s\u00e9cateur\n\n\n Spanish\n\nScyther\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nSichlor\n\nFrom Sichel and possibly \u87b3\u8782 t\u014dr\u014d\n\n\n Italian\n\nScyther\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc2a4\ub77c\ud06c Srak\n\nCorruption of strike\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u98db\u5929\u87b3\u8782 / \u98de\u5929\u87b3\u8782 F\u0113iti\u0101nt\u00e1ngl\u00e1ng\n\nFrom \u98db\u5929 / \u98de\u5929 f\u0113iti\u0101n and \u87b3\u8782 t\u00e1ngl\u00e1ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u98db\u5929\u87b3\u8782 F\u0113it\u012bnt\u00f2hngl\u00f2hng\n\nFrom \u98db\u5929 f\u0113it\u012bn and \u87b3\u8782 t\u00f2hngl\u00f2hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0938\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0907\u0915\u0940\u091f Strikeet\n\nFrom strike or \u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30af Strike and \u0915\u0940\u091f keet\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0421\u043a\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435\u0440 Skayter\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e2a\u0e44\u0e15\u0e23\u0e04\u0e4c Satrai\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nTracey's Scyther\nBlue's Scyther\nBugsy's Scyther\nGoh's Scyther\nScizor (UNITE)\nWeaponry in the Pok\u00e9mon world\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0122: Mr. Mime\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0124: Jynx\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Scyther_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4144435\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monBug-type Pok\u00e9monFlying-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupGreen-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 13 Pok\u00e9monBug group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon with branched EvolutionsPok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Sinnoh Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hisui Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 500Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon whose base Attack stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon whose base Speed stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon with 20 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monShadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XDPok\u00e9mon with cross-generational EvolutionsPok\u00e9mon that evolve through tradingPok\u00e9mon that evolve through held itemsPok\u00e9mon that evolve by trading with a held itemPok\u00e9mon that evolve by trading holding Metal CoatPok\u00e9mon that evolve using Black AuguritePok\u00e9mon that lose a type upon evolvingPok\u00e9mon that are included in the Japan-only Pok\u00e9mon Stadium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 12 October 2024, at 21:11.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
