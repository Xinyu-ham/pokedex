It has bulbous eyes that protrude from the top of its head. A black and white swirl covers its belly, which is actually its organs showing through its thin skin. It appears to have white gloves on its hands and rounded, digit-less feet. When out of water, it sweats to keep its skin moist and healthy. This keeps it covered in an oily fluid that allows it to slip away from enemies. All of its skin feels this way except where its swirl is, which is instead very smooth. The swirl on its belly undulates slowly and staring at it induces drowsiness.\nEven though Poliwhirl is capable of moving on land, it prefers to stay in freshwater ponds and lakes where it has fewer natural enemies. It feeds on both bug and fish Pok\u00e9mon. While it will leave the water to capture bug Pok\u00e9mon, it will return and consume them underwater in safety. Its swirl is used to make children fall asleep. Poliwhirl's sweat is filled with slimy mucus. When captured by an enemy, it either slithers to escape or use its swirl to put the enemy to sleep.\n\n\nEvolution\nPoliwhirl evolves from Poliwag and evolves into either Poliwrath or Politoed.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nPoliwag\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPoliwhirl\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2197\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nPoliwrath\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2198\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nPolitoed\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #061\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nCapable of living in or out of water.

Melee\nPoliwhirl only appears as a random trophy.\n\nTrophy information\nPoliwhirl is a Tadpole Pok\u00e9mon able to live on either land or in the water. When on dry land, it's constantly sweating to keep its skin nice and slimy. When in danger, it spins the whirlpool marking on its stomach to put enemies into a deep sleep, then it runs away. It evolves into either Poliwrath or Politoed.\n\nTrivia\n Poliwhirl in the original Tokyo Pok\u00e9mon Center logo\nThe logo for the Pok\u00e9mon Center in Tokyo featured Poliwhirl until it was replaced by Piplup in July 2007.\nPoliwhirl was also featured prominently on the center of the November 22, 1999, issue of Time Magazine.\nPoliwhirl's sprites and artwork are inconsistent with respect to its gloves. Sometimes, they are depicted as mittens, while other times, they have separate fingers.\nAll spritework from FireRed and LeafGreen onwards feature Poliwhirl with mitten-like hands. Because of this, Poliwhirl is one of the few Pok\u00e9mon to have its Emerald sprite differ from the Ruby and Sapphire one.\nPoliwhirl shares its category with Poliwag, Poliwrath, and Tympole. They are all known as the Tadpole Pok\u00e9mon.\nOrigin\nPoliwhirl may be based on a tadpole and a frog. The spiral pattern on its belly is supposed to represent how the organs of tadpoles can sometimes be seen through their transparent skin. Its evolution is based on a tadpole's metamorphosis. Its arms appear to be based on gloves, and with its Fighting-type evolved form in mind, they may be based on boxing gloves specifically.\n\nName origin\nPoliwhirl may be a combination of polliwog (outdated term for tadpole) and whirl or whirlpool.\nNyorozo may be a combination of \u30cb\u30e7\u30ed\u30cb\u30e7\u30ed nyoronyoro (onomatopoeia for wriggling) and \u5c0f\u50e7 koz\u014d (youngster).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30cb\u30e7\u30ed\u30be Nyorozo\n\nFrom \u30cb\u30e7\u30ed\u30cb\u30e7\u30ed nyoronyoro and \u5c0f\u50e7 koz\u014d\n\n\n French\n\nT\u00eatarte\n\nFrom t\u00eatard and tarte\n\n\n Spanish\n\nPoliwhirl\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nQuaputzi\n\nFrom Kaulquappe and putzig\n\n\n Italian\n\nPoliwhirl\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc288\ub959\ucc59\uc774 Syuryukchaengi*\uc218\ub959\ucc59\uc774 Suryukchaengi*\n\nFrom \uc218\ub959 (\u6c34\u9678) suryuk and \uc62c\ucc59\uc774 olchaeng-i\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u868a\u9999\u541b W\u00e9nxi\u0101ngj\u016bn*\u868a\u9999\u86d9 W\u00e9nxi\u0101ngw\u0101*\n\nFrom \u868a\u9999 w\u00e9nxi\u0101ng and \u541b j\u016bnFrom \u868a\u9999 w\u00e9nxi\u0101ng and \u86d9 w\u0101\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u868a\u9999\u541b M\u0101nh\u0113unggw\u0101n*\u868a\u9999\u86d9 M\u0101nh\u0113ungw\u0101*\n\nFrom \u868a\u9999 m\u0101nh\u0113ung and \u541b gw\u0101nFrom \u868a\u9999 m\u0101nh\u0113ung and \u86d9 w\u0101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092c\u0948\u0902\u0917\u091a\u093f\u092c\u093f\u0917 Bangchibig\n\nFrom \u092c\u0948\u0902\u0917/\u092c\u0947\u0901\u0917 bang and big\n\n\n Icelandic\n\nFj\u00f6lrei\u00f0i*\n\nFrom the English name and rei\u00f0i\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nPolivirlas\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0440\u043b Polivirl\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e40\u0e19\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e42\u0e23\u0e42\u0e0b Niaoroso\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nMisty's Poliwhirl\nPoli\nPolibo\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0060: Poliwag\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0062: Poliwrath\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Poliwhirl_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128030\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monWater-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Slow experience groupBlue-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 12 Pok\u00e9monWater 1 group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon with branched EvolutionsPok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kitakami Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 385Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became both Special Attack and Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 18 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with cross-generational EvolutionsPok\u00e9mon that evolve by Evolution stonePok\u00e9mon that evolve using Water StonePok\u00e9mon that evolve through tradingPok\u00e9mon that evolve through held itemsPok\u00e9mon that evolve by trading with a held itemPok\u00e9mon that evolve by trading holding King's Rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 12:59.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
