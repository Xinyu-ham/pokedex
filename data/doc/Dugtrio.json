Each head is incredibly tough with a smooth surface, and has brown skin, black eyes, and a large, round, pink nose. Dugtrio's three heads think the same thoughts and act cooperatively, though on rare occasions may fight over which head gets to eat first. In order to make burrowing easier, each head will bob up and down to loosen the soil. Dugtrio can tunnel under the earth at 60\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) to a depth of 60 miles (100 kilometers), triggering tremors and earthquakes. It is capable of burrowing endlessly. Dugtrio lives in tunnels and caves under the earth. Dugtrio is considered important for agriculture as its digging aerates the soil and makes it suitable for farming. As shown in the Pikachu short Pikachu's Rescue Adventure, Dugtrio sometimes lives in hollow trees in forests. It maintains the soil and plants trees to revitalize wooded areas. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, the three triplets of Dugtrio is known to sleep together, never separating from each other. The trio's teamwork remains strong even when sleeping.[1]\nIn Generation II, Dugtrio and its pre-evolved form, Diglett, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Fissure.\n\nForms\nDugtrio has a regional form: Alolan Dugtrio.\nAlolan Dugtrio is visually very similar to its counterpart, except each head has a mop of golden hair formed from modified whiskers. The left head has a bob-cut, the right head has curly \"shoulder-length\" hair, and the last one has flowing hair that touches the ground behind it. This hair is made out of thin, yet heavy strands of steel, which grows slowly and continuously throughout Alolan Dugtrio's life.[2] The hairs act as a defensive measure, as well as sensors that can detect vibrations from long distances underground. In the Alola region, Alolan Dugtrio is regarded as a feminine deity of the earth, and taking its hairs is thought to bring bad luck.[2] They can also be found in the Coastal Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated.\nAlolan Dugtrio and its pre-evolution are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Tangling Hair as an Ability.\nWugtrio was once considered a regional variant of Dugtrio due to their resemblance, but it has since been reclassified as a completely separate species.\n\nEvolution\nDugtrio evolves from Diglett.\nAlolan Dugtrio evolves from Alolan Diglett.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nDugtrio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nDiglett\u00a0Ground\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nDugtrio\u00a0Ground\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlolan Dugtrio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nDiglettAlolan Form\u00a0Ground\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nDugtrioAlolan Form\u00a0Ground\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl: Dugtrio and Diglett can be found roaming the halls of the Grand Underground. When 40 Diglett (or Dugtrio, which counts as 3) have been found, all players in the same Grand Underground session will receive a variety of bonuses for a period of 4 minutes. These include raising the odds of finding a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon in a Pok\u00e9mon Hideaway from 1/4096 to 1/2048 and forcing all Stone Boxes found when mining to become Pretty Stone Boxes.\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: Dugtrio appears in a bonus stage that can be accessed by the Red Table. After the player has knocked out a number of Diglett, they must knock out the Dugtrio that appears to win.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team: Dugtrio sends the player to Mt. Steel to rescue his son in the third story mission of the game. Dugtrio loves to show off to his son, but often forgets that people can't see him underground.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness: Dugtrio is one of the members of the Wigglytuff Guild. He updates the Outlaw Notice Board and Job Bulletin Board with rotating boards. Like in the previous game, Diglett is his son. He believes that he can swim in the sea, despite being a Ground type.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #051\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nA team of Diglett triplets.

Cubone & Pok\u00e9mon Fossils can also be seen on the Ground Terrain.\n\nTrophy information\n\"A Mole Pok\u00e9mon. It has three heads that seem to all think the same thing. It lives in caves and is skilled at digging--no matter how hard the ground is, it can dig up to 62 miles below the surface. It's among the fastest of Ground-type Pok\u00e9mon, a characteristic that can be counted on in combat. Its Sand Tomb is an effective attack that prevents opponents from escaping.\"\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nDugtrio appears as a Spirit as well as returning in the Ground transformation of Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2\n\nTrivia\nDugtrio and its pre-evolved form share their category name with Drilbur. They are all known as the Mole Pok\u00e9mon.\nDugtrio has the highest base Speed stat of all Ground-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nOf all Pok\u00e9mon to have the highest Speed stat of their respective types, Dugtrio is the slowest.\nDespite being the only species seen within the halls of the Grand Underground in Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, Diglett and Dugtrio cannot actually be caught or traditionally encountered in any of the Pok\u00e9mon Hideaways.\nKantonian Dugtrio and Wugtrio have exactly the same base stats in the same distribution. Their pre-evolved forms also evolve starting at the same level.\nAlolan Dugtrio, Wugtrio and their pre-evolved forms share two Abilities, being Sand Veil and either Gooey or Tangling Hair, the latter two being variations of each other.\nIn Generation IX, prior to the Version 2.0.1 update of Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet, Kantonian Dugtrio was unable to learn Helping Hand via TM, while its pre-evolved form could.\nDesign quirks\nDue to being embedded in the ground, Diglett and Dugtrio have special interactions with certain mechanics in the Pok\u00e9mon games.\nIn the Pok\u00e9athlon, Diglett and Dugtrio are unable to jump. In Hurdle Dash, they dig under hurdles instead of jumping them, in Lamp Jump they cannot move, and in Disc Catch they can only move but not jump to catch the discs.\nSince Generation V, when Diglett and Dugtrio are sent out, they merely fade onto the screen instead of dropping down like all other Pok\u00e9mon.\nIn the Pok\u00e9 Transfer, Diglett and Dugtrio run between bushes rather than jump.\nOn the \"Compare\" screen of Pok\u00e9mon X and Y's Pok\u00e9dex, if the player taps the menu sprite of Diglett, Dugtrio, or Mega Gengar, the Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon will give up and disperse before even trying to lift it.\nDiglett, Dugtrio, Sandygast, Palossand, and Mega Gengar are immune to Telekinesis.\nIf a Z-Move animation, such as Supersonic Skystrike, results in showing Diglett or Dugtrio in the air, it is shown still embedded in the ground.\nDugtrio's body has been described inconsistently throughout the franchise's history. Originally, it was three Diglett forming a group of three, but more recent Pok\u00e9dex entries claim it split from a single Diglett into three - sometimes separate, sometimes sharing a body.\nDespite being described as three Diglett in some sources, their official weight is listed as being well over the weight of three Diglett.\nDugtrio is the only Ground-type Pok\u00e9mon consisting of multiple bodies.\nOrigin\nDugtrio appears to be based on artificial moles used in the Whac-A-Mole arcade games.\nAlolan Dugtrio's hair may be based on Pele's hair, a thin volcanic glass formed near Hawaiian volcanoes. The lore of taking its hairs may reference the modern Pele's Curse, while its reputation as a feminine deity may be a reference to Pele herself. The darker soil surrounding its body may be a reference to black sand, which is found on beaches near volcanoes. Its Steel type may be a reference to another kind of magnetic black sand found in placer deposits. It also resembles a stereotypical Southern California surfer with tanned skin and blonde hair.\n\nName origin\nDugtrio may be a combination of dug and trio (a group of three).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30c0\u30b0\u30c8\u30ea\u30aa Dugtrio\n\nFrom dug and trio\n\n\n French\n\nTriopikeur\n\nFrom trio, taupe and marteau-piqueur\n\n\n Spanish\n\nDugtrio\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nDigdri\n\nFrom dig and drei or Trio\n\n\n Italian\n\nDugtrio\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub2e5\ud2b8\ub9ac\uc624 Daktrio\n\nTransliteration of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u4e09\u5730\u9f20 S\u0101nd\u00ecsh\u01d4\n\nFrom \u4e09 s\u0101n, \u5730 d\u00ec, \u9f20 sh\u01d4, and \u5730\u9f20 d\u00ecsh\u01d4\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u4e09\u5730\u9f20 S\u0101amdeihsy\u00fa*\u4e09\u982d\u5730\u9f20 S\u0101amt\u00e0uhdeihsy\u00fa*\n\nFrom \u4e09 s\u0101am, \u5730 d\u00ec, \u9f20 sh\u01d4, and \u5730\u9f20 d\u00ecsh\u01d4From \u4e09 s\u0101am, \u982d t\u00e0uh, \u5730 d\u00ec, \u9f20 sh\u01d4, and \u5730\u9f20 d\u00ecsh\u01d4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0921\u0917\u091f\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u094b Dugtrio\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nDugtrijus\n\nFrom English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0414\u0430\u0433\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043e Dagtrio\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e14\u0e31\u0e01\u0e17\u0e23\u0e34\u0e42\u0e2d Dakthrio\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nRegional form\nWugtrio\nEcologically similar Pok\u00e9mon\nPok\u00e9mon fusion\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Dugtrio (archive)\n\n\nExternal links\n\n Alolan forms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: Regional forms (Alolan \u2022 Galarian \u2022 Hisuian \u2022 Paldean) \u2022 Ecologically similar Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\nEcologically similar Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also:Regional forms (Alolan \u2022 Galarian \u2022 Hisuian \u2022 Paldean)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0050: Diglett\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0052: Meowth\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Dugtrio_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4127887\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monGround-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monSteel-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupBrown-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 11 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with different formsField group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 405Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special DefensePok\u00e9mon whose base Speed stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 425Pok\u00e9mon with 17 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monShadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XDPok\u00e9mon that are included in the Japan-only Pok\u00e9mon StadiumPok\u00e9mon whose base stats changed in Generation VII\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 11:51.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
