It has a round head flanked by three large, spiked protrusions on either side. It has triangular eyes with small pupils and a mouth with a long, pink tongue. The gases composing its head curve into its mouth to form several pointed teeth. Disembodied hands with three clawed fingers each float in front of its body. Its body tapers into a jagged tail. Haunter's gaseous form makes it one of the lightest Pok\u00e9mon in existence.\nHaunter hides in very dark places, such as caves, and is afraid of light. If a human or a Pok\u00e9mon comes near Haunter, it will stalk the victim while floating and beckon it to come closer. Once approached it will then lick the victim with its gaseous tongue, inflicting convulsions in the victim that last until death. It can also float through walls. It has been shown in Pok\u00e9mon the Series that it can control its hands from far away and can control any Pok\u00e9mon that it touches with its hands. Haunter have also been depicted as being able to create illusions,[1] pull out spirits from an individual\u2019s body,[2] and even remove its own eyes from its face[3]. Despite its predatory nature, it is known to entertain and prank people, such as in the episode The Tower of Terror. Additionally, in A Shipful of Shivers, it is even shown to feel intense loyalty to a deceased Trainer. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Haunter is known to sleep while floating.[4] A sleeping Haunter will steal the life-force of anyone who comes near using its gaseous tongue.\nIn Generation I, Night Shade was its signature move.\n\nEvolution\nHaunter evolves from Gastly and evolves into Gengar.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nGastly\u00a0Ghost\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nHaunter\u00a0Ghost\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nGengar\u00a0Ghost\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: Two Haunter appear in a bonus stage accessible from the Red Table.

However, in most of Haunter's depictions in other media, such as throughout Pok\u00e9mon the Series (including the original series), it has always been depicted with two fingers and a thumb.\n\n\n\n\n\nRed and Green sprite\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuby and Sapphire sprite\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed and Green art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal series art\n\n\n\n\nOrigin\nHaunter appears to be based on a ghost. It shares many similarities with the y\u014dkai akaguchi, a creature with a wide mouth and a long tongue whose body is covered by dark clouds, making only its head and clawed hands visible.\nWhile Haunter's long tongue is a recurring theme among many y\u014dkai, its vampiric licking might have come from the Dila, a Philippine spirit that licked the life energy of sick people until they died, or from some variants of the akaname.\nSome of Haunter's traits, such as its Poison type and extremely light weight, seem to be based on Fuy\u016brei, floating spirits said to be able to spread diseases.\n\nName origin\nHaunter may be derived from haunt and the agentive suffix -er or possibly hunter.\nGhost is literally ghost.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b4\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8 Ghost\n\nFrom ghost\n\n\n French\n\nSpectrum\n\nFrom spectre\n\n\n Spanish\n\nHaunter\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nAlpollo\n\nFrom Alptraum and Apollo\n\n\n Italian\n\nHaunter\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uace0\uc6b0\uc2a4\ud2b8 Goust\n\nFrom ghost\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u9b3c\u65af\u901a Gu\u01d0s\u012bt\u014dng\n\nFrom \u9b3c gu\u01d0 and a rough transcription of the Japanese name or possibly \u74e6\u65af w\u01ces\u012b, and \u901a t\u014dng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u9b3c\u65af\u901a Gw\u00e1is\u012bt\u016bng\n\nFrom \u9b3c gw\u00e1i and a rough transcription of the Japanese name or possibly \u74e6\u65af ng\u00e1hs\u012b, and \u901a t\u016bng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d4\u05d5\u05e0\u05d8\u05e8 Honter\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0939\u0949\u0928\u094d\u091f\u0930 Haunter\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0425\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440 Khonter\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e42\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e17\u0e4c Kot\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nSabrina's Haunter\nBlack Fog\nGengar (UNITE)\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Illusion Confusion\n\n\u2191 The Tower of Terror\n\n\u2191 Haunter versus Kadabra\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0092: Gastly\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0094: Gengar\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Haunter_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4129108\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monGhost-type Pok\u00e9monPoison-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon without Hidden AbilitiesPok\u00e9mon in the Medium Slow experience groupPurple-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 04 Pok\u00e9monAmorphous group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Sinnoh Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hisui Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kitakami Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 405Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon whose base Special Attack stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon whose base Special stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon with 18 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that evolve through tradingPok\u00e9mon that evolve using Linking Cord\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 22:28.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
