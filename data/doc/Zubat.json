While it lacks eyes, it has pointed ears with purple insides and a mouth with two sharp teeth on each jaw. A male will have larger fangs than a female. It has purple wing membranes supported by two, elongated fingers, and two long, thin tails.\nZubat lives in abundance in dark caves, although it has also been known to dwell in forests and under the eaves of old buildings. Due to its habitat, Zubat has evolved to have neither eyes nor nostrils. It instead navigates through dark environments and tight caves with echolocation, emitting ultrasonic cries to detect targets and obstacles. The frequency of these cries can vary slightly between Zubat colonies. As demonstrated in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Clefairy and the Moon Stone, it will leave its abode at night with a mass of other Zubat in order to seek prey. Zubat is nocturnal, and sleeps hanging upside down during the daytime, avoiding sunlight at all costs. Daylight causes Zubat to become unhealthy, and prolonged exposure can even burn its skin. However, captured and trained Zubat have been recorded as being much more tenacious in the daytime, even when directly exposed to sunbeams. While sleeping, or in colder conditions, Zubat gathers with others of its kind for warmth.\n\n\n\n\n\nZubat hanging upside-down\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZubat using its echolocation\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nZubat evolves into Golbat, which evolves into Crobat.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nZubat\u00a0Poison\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nGolbat\u00a0Poison\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nCrobat\u00a0Poison\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness: Zubat is a member of Team Skull, along with Koffing and the leader Skuntank.

They are all known as the Bat Pok\u00e9mon.\nZubat's evolutionary line has several similarities with Woobat's.\nAll of the members of both lines are called the Bat Pok\u00e9mon (excluding Swoobat), live in caves or other dark places, and have no visible eyes at their respective unevolved states.\nMembers of both lines reach their respective fully evolved forms by friendship and both have similar Shiny forms (with green main bodies).\nWoobat and Zubat have somewhat similar English names, both having rhyming prefixes and bat as a suffix.\nZubat can also be seen as a parallel to Noibat, as they are both Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon based on bats and can have Infiltrator as a possible Ability. They also share the same base stats, with their Attack and Special Attack switched around.\nZubat has the lowest base Special Attack stat of all Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon, tying with Taillow, Starly, Combee, and Pikipek.\nDespite its lack of eyes, Zubat is still capable of learning Mean Look.\nDue to its lack of eyes, Zubat is the only Pok\u00e9mon whose Alpha form in Legends: Arceus does not bear glowing red eyes.\nIt is also one of the few Shadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon GO that doesn't have red eyes, the other being Shadow Steelix.\nOrigin\nZubat seems to be based on a bat, particularly vampire bats, which bite other animals to feed on their blood. Its Poison type may be inspired by either the anticoagulant properties of vampire bat saliva or the fact that bats are infamous for spreading deadly diseases such as rabies. Its lack of eyes could be a reference to troglomorphism and may additionally be influenced by the misconception that bats are blind due to their use of echolocation to navigate.
