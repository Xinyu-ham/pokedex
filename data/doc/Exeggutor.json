Its body and legs are light brown with thin black rings and its legs are thick with two-toed feet. There is a light yellow paw pad on each foot's underside. It has thin, green leaves sprouting from the top of its body. Exeggutor has three round, light yellow heads that resemble coconuts, each with different facial expressions.\nExeggutor's heads think independently and don't appear interested in one another, so it makes a lot of noise as each head speaks its mind. They still appear to get along, though, for they never squabble amongst themselves. If all the heads want to go in a different direction, its body is unable to move. They are able to communicate telepathically as well and sometimes use it to come to a joint decision. It uses psychic powers to fight, and since all three heads are capable its power is tripled. If one of these heads grows too large, it falls off and groups together with others to become an Exeggcute. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The March of the Exeggutor Squad, Exeggutor also has been seen in groups of its own kind, meaning that it is not a solitary Pok\u00e9mon. Exeggutor has been referred to as \"The Walking Tropical Rainforest\" or \"The Walking Jungle\". It can be sluggish during cloudy days due to the lack of sunlight. Being the result of an evolution via Evolution stone, Exeggutor is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in forests and jungles.\nExeggutor and its pre-evolved form, Exeggcute, are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Barrage.\n\nForms\n Alolan Exeggutor, in comparison to its original counterpart, grows abundantly due to Alola's sun\nExeggutor has a regional form: Alolan Exeggutor.\nDue to the abundance of sunlight in the Alola region, the Exeggutor that live there grow over five times taller than those in other regions. The region is considered to be the best environment for Alolan Exeggutor. Alolan Exeggutor's neck is thinner and much longer, causing it to more closely resemble a coconut tree or tropical palm tree than its Kantonian counterpart, which resembles the shorter desert palm. It has a long, tapering tail with two leaves and a fourth light green head on the tip.\nThis extra head can also act on its own and defend the rear.[1] The tail can use weak telepathy to scan the surrounding area. Its long neck can be used as a whip to attack enemies with its hard head. However, its neck can also be a weak point, as it will become dizzy swinging it around. Its increased height reduced its need for a psychic defense and has instead awakened its draconic powers, resulting in its psychic powers becoming weaker.\nAncient carvings and murals depict this Pok\u00e9mon. Alolan Exeggutor is considered the pride of the Alola region by its natives. Alolans take pride in its appearance, claiming this is what Exeggutor ought to look like. Its extra height makes it the tallest and heaviest Grass-type. Alolan Exeggutor can be found on Exeggutor Island, a former trial site in Alola, which is not only shaped like an Exeggutor, but contains many wild Exeggutor, giving the island its name. They can also be found in the Coastal Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated.\nIn Generation VII, Dragon Hammer was its signature move, but Tropius could still inherit it via breeding.\n\n\nEvolution\nExeggutor evolves from Exeggcute.\nIn Alola, Exeggutor has a regional form that evolves from Exeggcute.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nExeggcute\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nExeggutor\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nExeggutorAlolan Form\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Dragon\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #103\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nLegend has it that on rare occasions, one of its heads will drop off and continue on as an Exeggcute.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nIts cries are very noisy.

Ultimate\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nAlolan Exeggutor appears as a Pok\u00e9mon summoned from the Pok\u00e9 Ball, where it acts as a stage barrier, blocking players from crossing over a certain part of the stage for a set period of time. Its neck acts as a wall, so certain characters, such as Greninja, can stick on to it or jump off it. Alolan Exeggutor also appears as a Spirit.\n\n\nTrivia\n An elongated Exeggutor\nAlolan Exeggutor is the heaviest Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nTwo of Ash's Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon the Series have evolved after fighting and defeating Exeggutor. Ash's Charmander evolved into Charmeleon after defeating several Exeggutor, with some help from Melvin's fire power. Later on, Ash's Krabby evolved into Kingler after defeating Mandi's Exeggutor in the first round of the Indigo Plateau Conference.\nExeggutor is Tsunekazu Ishihara's favorite Pok\u00e9mon. He used it all throughout the debugging and testing of Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green.[2]\nAlolan Exeggutor was created by Ken Sugimori.[3]\nAlolan Exeggutor was also the first regional form to be created for Sun and Moon.[4]\nThe artwork for the Japanese Jungle booster box depicts Exeggutor with an elongated body and no visible legs.\nAside from special badges, Alolan Exeggutor's is the only mega badge in the Nintendo Badge Arcade.\nExeggutor is a rare example of a Pok\u00e9mon that is capable of devolution, because when one of its heads grows too big, it falls off, becoming an Exeggcute in the process.\nExeggcute and Kantonian Exeggutor are the only Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon in the Grass Egg Group.\nAlolan Exeggutor was the first Alolan form to be officially revealed.\nExeggutor is the only Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet to have both its original form and regional form appear in the same Pok\u00e9dex, with both forms appearing in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dex.\nDesign variations\nMain article: Variant Pok\u00e9mon \u2192 Exeggcute and Exeggutor\n Exeggutor with five heads in The March of the Exeggutor Squad\nThe number of heads Exeggutor has used to vary in earlier media. Exeggutor is depicted with an extra head on its back in every core series game up until Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen. In its Pok\u00e9dex entry for Pok\u00e9mon Crystal, it is stated that \"living in a good environment makes it grow lots of heads\". In the early seasons of Pok\u00e9mon the Series, it was occasionally depicted with more than three heads, often distributed in a ring around its torso rather than just on the front. In The March of the Exeggutor Squad, an Exeggutor's leaves are cut, revealing five heads. Additionally, official game art during this period also depicted Exeggutor with its heads distributed around its body, though not exceeding three heads. However, from FireRed and LeafGreen onwards, Exeggutor is consistently depicted with three heads on the front, and none on the back across official media.\n\nOrigin\nExeggutor appears to be based on a coconut tree or desert palm tree and possibly the Japanese monster Jinmenju, a tree that grows human heads that are always smiling. It might also be inspired by a yucca plant, with its bulky trunk and blade-like leaves. It may also draw inspiration from Buddhist asuras, three-headed demigods whose faces are sometimes said to each express one of the emotions of joy, anger, and sorrow. This quality is also reflected in another Pok\u00e9mon, Dodrio. Exeggutor's Psychic type may come from the idea of telepathy.\nAlolan Exeggutor more closely resembles a coconut tree or tropical palm tree. Its Dragon type may be a reference to the Dracaena genus of trees. It may also be a pun inspired by the Coca, a dragon whose name shares the same origins as the word coconut. Its dramatically larger size may also reference island gigantism.\n\nName origin\nExeggutor may be a combination of egg and executor.\nNassy may be a combination of \u30b3\u30b3\u30ca\u30c3\u30c4 kokonattsu (coconuts) and \u6930\u5b50 yashi (palm tree).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30ca\u30c3\u30b7\u30fc Nassy\n\nFrom coconuts and
