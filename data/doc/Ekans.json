Its eyes, underbelly, the thick stripe around its neck, and the rattle are yellow. Ekans have three pairs of black lines encircling their body, and another line connects to each slit-pupil eye and curves toward its nose. Its large mouth has a round, pink tongue and no visible teeth. While painful, a newborn Ekans's bite is not venomous. This Pok\u00e9mon grows longer with age.\nEkans live in grassy savannas and plains, moving stealthily through the grass. It can also be found in forests and desolate wastelands, where it preys on Eggs from Pidgey and Spearow nests but will strike other prey from behind. By flicking its tongue out, it can detect danger and the scent of prey. Its jaw can detach to swallow large prey, but such a meal can make Ekans too heavy to move or become stuck and cause them to faint. It wraps itself around tree branches at night to rest. If not in a tree, it will coil itself up\u2014a position in which it can defend itself from all directions. In the second movie, it is revealed to possess some swimming abilities. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Ekans are known to sleep with their bodies all coiled up. It is believed that Ekans do this to terrify foes, no matter which direction the foe is.\nBefore Generation II, Ekans and its evolved form, Arbok, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Glare.\n\nEvolution\nEkans evolves into Arbok.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nEkans\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nArbok\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Ekans is a member of Team Meanies.

It debuted in Pok\u00e9mon Emergency!, which also marked the species' debut. It was extremely loyal to her and eventually evolved into an Arbok in Dig Those Diglett! just to make her happy.\n\nTeam Meanies\nEkans was part of Team Meanies in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Team Go-Getters Out of the Gate!. Gengar commanded the Poisonous Snake Pok\u00e9mon to eat all of the Berries Team Go-Getters had collected. At one point, Ekans was incorrectly referred to as Arbok by Gengar. While this was an intentional error that Ekans rebuked in the original version (due to the similarities between the Japanese names), this came across as a general mistake in the dub and was corrected in reruns of the episode.\n\nOther\nIn A Poached Ego!, multiple Ekans were captured by Rico. Jessie released her Arbok along with James's Weezing so they could protect these Ekans and a group of captured Koffing.\nIn Turning Heads and Training Hard!, a Team Skull Grunt's Ekans was quickly defeated by Ilima and his Eevee. In Battle Royal 151!, it competed in the Manalo Conference, only to be defeated by Ilima's Eevee again.\nIn Dreams Are Made of These!, Goh caught an Ekans during a Pok\u00e9mon Orienteering competition.

This was changed in later art.\nAn Ekans was originally going to be featured in Pok\u00e9mon Snap, as shown in an early test shot of an environment that was never featured in the final product. This is also true of its evolution, Arbok.\nEkans is one of fourteen Pok\u00e9mon that one can collect foreign Pok\u00e9dex entries for in Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl.\nEkans has never been scanned with a Pok\u00e9dex in the animated series, despite debuting in the second episode of the original series. Thusly, it is the Pok\u00e9mon with the most episodes aired after its debut without it getting a Pok\u00e9dex entry.\nOrigin\nEkans seems to be based on various snakes. Its venomous bite and tail rattle are similar to a rattlesnake, while its lack of visible teeth and diet of eggs are similar to an egg-eating snake. The single yellow stripe around its neck is reminiscent of the ring-necked snake, and the line connecting its eyes is reminiscent of the marking on the back of the Indian cobra's hood. The fact that it is in the Dragon Egg Group and its ability to learn Glare may be a reference to the legendary basilisk, a venomous, serpentine dragon said to be able to kill people with its stare.\n\nName origin\nEkans is snake spelled backwards.[1][2]\nArbo may be derived from cobra or \u30dc\u30a2 boa spelled backwards.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30a2\u30fc\u30dc Arbo\n\nFrom cobra or \u30dc\u30a2 boa spelled backwards\n\n\n French\n\nAbo\n\nFrom an anagram of boa\n\n\n Spanish\n\nEkans\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nRettan\n\nFrom Natter spelled backwards\n\n\n Italian\n\nEkans\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc544\ubcf4 Abo\n\nFrom an anagram of \ubcf4\uc544 boa\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u963f\u67cf\u86c7 \u0100b\u00f3sh\u00e9\n\nFrom the transcription of Japanese name and \u86c7 sh\u00e9\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u963f\u67cf\u86c7 \u00c1baaks\u00e8h\n\nFrom the transcription of Japanese name and \u86c7 s\u00e8h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d0\u05e7\u05e0\u05e1 Ekans\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0910\u0915\u0902\u0938 Ekans\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nEkansas\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u042d\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441 Ekans\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e42\u0e1a Abo\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nJessie's Ekans\nEkans Brothers\nTeam Meanies\nReferences\n\n\u2191 The Official Pok\u00e9mon Handbook, p. 36\n\n\u2191 (February 27, 2016). \"\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u304c\u73fe\u5b9f\u4e16\u754c\u3068\u4eee\u60f3\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u7e4b\u3044\u3067\u3044\u304f\u300120\u5e74\u76ee\u306e\u6311\u6226\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u4ee3\u8868\u53d6\u7de0\u5f79\u793e\u9577\u30fb\u77f3\u539f\u6052\u548c\u6c0f\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\" inside-games.jp.\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0022: Fearow\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0024: Arbok\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Ekans_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4129078\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monPoison-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupPurple-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 02 Pok\u00e9monField group Pok\u00e9monDragon group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kitakami Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 288Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with 18 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 22:10.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
