On top of its head is a large pair of gray, spiky pincers on top of its head. In its mouth are many long, flat teeth arranged horizontally and it has triangular eyes. Capable of seeing color to some degree, Pinsir appears to be attracted to the color green. Its legs are short and thick, while its arms are long and thin. It has three claws on each hand and foot; two of its toes face forward and one backward.\nPinsir can use its pincers to crush, toss, bludgeon, or tear opponents; lift things twice its weight; and shatter logs. Captured prey is kept in place by the piercing thorns and sheer strength of Pinsir's horns and will not be released until they are torn in half. Pinsir's horns are quite flexible as depicted in the Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards where they have a wide range of motion. In addition to hunting prey, it's shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode A Sappy Ending that it enjoys tree sap. Pinsir lives deep in the temperate forests and jungles, where it burrows underground or hides in the treetops on nights cold enough to render it immobile. In Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Pinsir burrows itself into the ground to sleep during cold nights but its pincers can be seen sticking out of the ground as it slumbers. In Alola, it has a rivalry with Vikavolt and gets along with Heracross. Pinsir are known to judge each other based on their pincers. The pincers determine its popularity with the opposite gender based on how more thick and impressive it looks.\n\nForms\nPinsir can Mega Evolve into Mega Pinsir.\nAs Mega Pinsir, it gains a large pair of clear, yellow wings with an area of orange venation near the base. Additionally, a set of brown elytra appear. Slicing through each elytron is a pair of orange blades. Its arms become longer and it has a T-shaped spike on each forearm. The pincers on its head are now longer with larger spikes, and its eyes are now yellow.\nWhen it Mega Evolves, Pinsir is left in a constant state of excitement. It rarely touches the ground due to its ability to now fly. Mega Pinsir can travel up to approximately 30\u00a0mph (50\u00a0km/h) and uses its two large horns to pierce its enemies before shredding them. Mega Pinsir can lift opponents up to 10 times heavier than itself with its horns and still fly around easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMegaPinsir\n\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Stadium 2: Pinsir stars in a mini-game alongside Scyther called \"Clear Cut Challenge.\" Each player chops a falling log for each round of the game. The score for each player is determined by how close the player is to the white line on the log. Cuts anywhere above the log will cause the player to lose points.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #127\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nIf it fails to crush the victim in its pincers, it will swing it around and toss it hard.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nGrips its prey in its pincers and squeezes hard!

Pinsir is exclusive to Blue, LeafGreen, Pearl, and Let's Go, Eevee!, while Scyther is exclusive to Red, FireRed, Diamond, and Let's Go, Pikachu!.\nPinsir can also be seen as a counterpart to Heracross. Both are Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon based on beetles and lack an evolutionary line. Pinsir is not part Fighting like Heracross, but it learns several Fighting-type moves by leveling up. Both Pok\u00e9mon and their Mega Stones are version exclusives in X and Y: Pinsir and Pinsirite are exclusive to X while Heracross and Heracronite are exclusive to Y. Each Mega Stone can be found in Santalune Forest in its respective version. The heights of both Pok\u00e9mon are the same, even when Mega Evolved. The Pok\u00e9mon are also version exclusives in the Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield Expansion Pass. Pinsir can be found on the Isle of Armor if playing Sword, whereas Heracross can be found in its place when playing Shield.\nMega Pinsir is tied with Mega Heracross, Mega Scizor, and Genesect for the highest base stat total of all Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nPinsir shares its category with Vikavolt. They are both known as the Stag Beetle Pok\u00e9mon.\nIn X and Y, Mega Pinsir has the same shape as when it is not Mega Evolved.\nPinsir's attraction to the color green may be a reference to how it is exclusive to Pok\u00e9mon Green. This is similar to Scyther's depiction in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Showdown at Dark City where Scyther becomes enraged at the sight of the color red, with Scyther likewise being exclusive to Pok\u00e9mon Red.\nOrigin\nPinsir seems to be based on a stag beetle, possibly Prosopocoilus inclinatus, a species commonly used in insect fighting. Its thorn-like mandibles most closely resemble that of Lucanus maculifemoratus hopei, whereas its Mega Evolved form's diagonal spikes resemble Calcodes versicolor.\n\nName origin\nPinsir is a corruption of pincer, referring to its horns.\nKailios may be a combination of the Greek letter \u03a7 (\u30ab\u30a4 kai), \u5208 kai (shear), \u9b41\u5049 kaii (brawny), cross (referring to its scissor-like horns), and \u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 korios (Greek for bug).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30ab\u30a4\u30ed\u30b9 Kailios\n\nFrom \u03a7, \u5208 kai, \u9b41\u5049 kaii, cross, and \u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2 korios\n\n\n French\n\nScarabrute\n\nFrom scarab\u00e9e and brute\n\n\n Spanish\n\nPinsir\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nPinsir\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Italian\n\nPinsir\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc058\uc0ac\uc774\uc800 Ppeusaizeo\n\nFrom \ubd80\uc218\ub2e4 busuda, \ubfd4 ppul, and scissors\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u51f1\u7f85\u65af / \u51ef\u7f57\u65af K\u01ceilu\u00f3s\u012b*\u5927\u7532 D\u00e0ji\u01ce*\n\nTranscription of Japanese nameFrom \u5927 d\u00e0, \u7532 ji\u01ce, and \u7532\u87f2 / \u7532\u866b ji\u01cech\u00f3ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u51f1\u7f85\u65af H\u00f3il\u00f2hs\u012b*\u9257\u5200\u7532\u87f2 K\u00echmd\u014dugaapch\u00f9hng*\n\nMandarin-based transcription of Japanese nameFrom \u9257 k\u00echm, \u5200 d\u014du, and \u7532\u87f2 gaapch\u00f9hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092a\u093f\u0902\u0938\u0930 Pinsir\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041f\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0438\u0440 Pinsir\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e44\u0e04\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e2a Khailot\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nGoh's Pinsir\nMega Evolution\nExternal links\n\n Mega Evolutions \nIntroduced in Pok\u00e9mon X and Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduced in Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: Primal Reversion \u2022 Bond Phenomenon \u2022 Ultra Burst\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0126: Magmar\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0128: Tauros\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Pinsir_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4134759\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monBug-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monFlying-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Slow experience groupBrown-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 12 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with Mega EvolutionsBug group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hoenn Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Unova Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 500Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon whose base Attack stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 600Pok\u00e9mon whose base Defense stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon whose base Speed stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon with 19 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are not part of an evolutionary lineBody style 13 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are included in the Japan-only Pok\u00e9mon StadiumShadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 30 September 2024, at 12:15.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
