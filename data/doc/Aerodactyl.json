It has small sharply pointed ears, narrow dark green eyes, a ridged snout, a gaping mouth, and a strong lower jaw full of serrated fangs. Its body is covered in light blue-gray skin and it has large, violet membranous wings. The clawed hands at the end of each wing allow it to grasp objects. There is a hump-like ridge with a spike on its back, and it has a strong tail with an arrow-shaped tip. Its talon-like feet have two toes in front and one in the back, and are capable of scooping up and tightly clutching its prey in flight.\nAerodactyl's serrated saw-like fangs and ferocious attitude were very imposing in its time. Its fangs can rip out throats and tear through the skin of any Pok\u00e9mon to pieces, even Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon. By spreading its wings, Aerodactyl is believed to have flown by gliding through the skies, freely letting out its high-pitched cries. However, it is slow to walk on land. It liked to nest in the mountains, where it enjoyed both safety and seclusion. Aerodactyl lived in prehistoric times, and was theorized to become extinct thanks to a giant meteor impact. It was restored in modern times using genetic material extracted from amber; some casualties occurred during these attempts. Even still, this restoration is not considered perfect.\n\nForms\nAerodactyl can Mega Evolve into Mega Aerodactyl.\nAs Mega Aerodactyl, its eyes turn bright green and parts of its body turn to stone, which some researchers believe to be its original appearance before fossilization. It grows larger and sprouts jagged black spiky rocks all over its body: five spikes at the wrist joint of each wing replacing its hands, three small spikes along its tail, one spike on each ear, and a long spike on its chin. The spike on its back and its rear talons have also become black and stony. Rocky plates cover its eyebrows and the corners of its jaw. Similar stone ornaments are present on its chest on its torso: two small ridges flanking a longer ridge.\nThe power of Mega Evolution allows some of Aerodactyl's dormant genes to reawaken. Some scholars claim that Mega Aerodactyl is Aerodactyl's true appearance from prehistory before it was revived. Some of the rocks on Mega Aerodactyl's body are harder than diamond. Because of the burden of Mega Evolution, Mega Aerodactyl is fiercer and more irritable than before. As a result, Mega Aerodactyl attacks anything that moves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMegaAerodactyl\n\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire: In the Ruby Field, once an Egg has been hatched, Aerodactyl will fly by and replace it the next time the ball rolls into the Egg Stand.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #142\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nA ferocious, prehistoric Pok\u00e9mon that goes for the enemy's throat with its serrated saw-like fangs.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nA savage Pok\u00e9mon that died out in ancient times.

It was ordered to chase after Ash and Latias.

He has since then used him extensively for aerial transportation and combat.\n\nYellow arc\nLance has his own Aerodactyl that he also uses for aerial transportation and combat which first appeared in Extricated from Exeggutor.

They are all known as the Fossil Pok\u00e9mon.\nAerodactyl was the inspiration for the naming of Aerodactylus, a genus of pterosaurs. The genus name was chosen in reference to Aerodactyl having traits derived from various pterosaur species.[1]\nAerodactyl is the only Fossil Pok\u00e9mon with a Mega Evolved form.\nPrior to Generation VIII, it was also the only Fossil Pok\u00e9mon that can be obtained in any way other than breeding, reviving its Fossil, or from the Dream World: it is available through an in-game trade in Generation II, as a gift in Generation VII, and is one of Hayley's trades.\nThe trade in Generation II was removed in HeartGold and SoulSilver Versions, likely because the Old Amber could be obtained and revived in these games, unlike in Generation II.\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue beta, Aerodactyl was originally known as \"Ptera\", its Japanese name.\nAerodactyl is the only Pok\u00e9mon owned by Lance and Clair in the core series who is not a Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon nor a Pok\u00e9mon belonging to the Dragon Egg group.\nThis is likely due to pterosaurs being known as \"winged dragons\" (\u7ffc\u7adc yokury\u016b) in Japanese, further explaining why it is called a \"dragon\" by an old man in Pewter Museum of Science in Generations I, III, and VII, as well as suggesting why its appearance is influenced by that of wyverns.\nMega Aerodactyl has the highest base Speed stat of all Rock-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nAerodactyl is one of four non-Hoenn Dex Pok\u00e9mon available in Pok\u00e9mon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire. The others are Chikorita, Cyndaquil and Totodile.\nMega Aerodactyl has a unique base stat total of 615.\nAerodactyl is the only Generation I Rock-type Pok\u00e9mon to not possess a 4\u00d7 weakness to Grass-type moves.\nAerodactyl is the first Fossil Pok\u00e9mon to have its Egg shown in the animated series.\nIn the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, Aerodactyl was stated to be the predecessor of birds. This, alongside many facts in the book, would be retconned by future content in the games, specifically by the introduction of Archeops.\nOrigin\nAerodactyl's design is mostly based on pterodactyloids, a family of pterosaurs that lived in the Jurassic period. Its long tail, however, is derived from rhamphorhynchids. Additionally, its pointed wings, spaded tail, and robust jaws give it the resemblance of a dragon, specifically wyverns.\nThe rocks that appear on Mega Aerodactyl's body is a reference to atavism whereby an ancestral genetic trait reappears after having been lost through evolutionary change in previous generations. The rock on Mega Aerodactyl's chin is similar to goatee.\n\nName origin\nAerodactyl may be a combination of \u1f00\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 a\u00e9ros (Greek for air) or aeroplane, and pterodactyl.\nPtera may be derived from pterosaur or Pteranodon.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30d7\u30c6\u30e9 Ptera\n\nFrom pterosaur\n\n\n French\n\nPt\u00e9ra\n\nSame as Japanese name\n\n\n Spanish\n\nAerodactyl\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nAerodactyl\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Italian\n\nAerodactyl\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ud504\ud14c\ub77c Ptera\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5316\u77f3\u7ffc\u9f8d / \u5316\u77f3\u7ffc\u9f99 Hu\u00e0sh\u00edy\u00ecl\u00f3ng\n\nFrom \u5316\u77f3 hu\u00e0sh\u00ed and \u7ffc\u9f8d / \u7ffc\u9f99 y\u00ecl\u00f3ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5316\u77f3\u98db\u9f8d Fasehkyihkl\u00f9hng*\u5316\u77f3\u98db\u9f8d Fasehkf\u0113il\u00f9hng*\n\nFrom \u5316\u77f3 fasehk and \u7ffc\u9f8d yihkl\u00f9hngFrom \u5316\u77f3 fasehk and \u7ffc\u9f8d f\u0113il\u00f9hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0910\u0930\u094b\u0921\u0948\u0915\u094d\u091f\u093f\u0932 Aerodactyl\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0410\u044d\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c Aerodaktil'\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e1e\u0e40\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e32 Phathoera\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nAero\nGoh's Aerodactyl\nFossil\nMega Evolution\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Vidovic, S.
