It has red eyes, a cream-colored beak, a red gem in the center of its forehead, and four spikes on the back of its head. Its hands and feet all have three clawed digits with cream-colored webbing in between. Its body is specially adapted to have a hydrodynamic shape, and it has a long tail that it uses as a rudder to steer. Golduck is sometimes mistaken for the Japanese monster, and the physical inspiration for Golduck, the Kappa due to its general humanoid shape, beak, and webbed hands and feet.\nGolduck is a fast swimmer, capable of out-swimming even the most athletic of humans because of its webbed appendages. Even rough seas do not hamper this Pok\u00e9mon's swimming abilities, and it will sometimes rescue people from shipwrecks. The TCG depicts Golduck with the ability to shoot massive jets of water form both of its hands simultaneously, using them to propel itself underwater. The gem on its forehead glows when it uses its psychic powers, and occasionally when it swims at full speed. In the past, this Pok\u00e9mon was overhunted due to the belief that the gem granted people supernatural powers. As seen in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, Golduck has the ability to give knowledge to its Trainer and fellow Pok\u00e9mon through telepathy. Golduck can typically be seen swimming in lakes, where it hunts fish. The prey is disabled, captured, and then brought to shore for consumption. Old tales claim Golduck punishes those who defile their rivers by dragging them in and taking them away. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Golduck is known to paddle its webbed limbs while sleeping.[1]It is believed Golduck is dreaming about swimming.\nPrior to Generation V, Golduck and its pre-evolved form, Psyduck, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Cloud Nine as an Ability.\n\n\n\n\n\nGolduck using telepathy in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGolduck shooting water from its hands\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nGolduck evolves from Psyduck.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nPsyduck\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nGolduck\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #055\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nOften seen swimming elegantly by lake shores.
