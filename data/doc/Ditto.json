It is often referred to as amorphous, but has a relatively consistent appearance in official artwork, including two small nubs on its \"head\", a few soft lumps at its base, and two pseudopod-like protrusions in place of arms. The face consists of beady eyes and a simple mouth; almost always pulled into a smile.\nDitto bears a variety of unusual and often entirely unique traits that set it apart from every other Pok\u00e9mon. It is capable of transforming into an exact replica of any physical object or living creature, including its form and abilities. Each Ditto has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transforming; being unable to remain transformed while laughing and getting details of its transformation wrong if based on memory being apparently universal. The Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards depict Ditto being able to transform separate sections of its body into parts from multiple Pok\u00e9mon at once. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Ditto's Mysterious Mansion, as well as in the TCG and some spin-off games, it is shown that occasionally Ditto cannot change its face during transformation; a trait that has become synonymous with the species despite being incongruous with their depiction in core series games. While its transformation ability allows it to get along with almost anything, it does not get along with its own kind, which it will quickly (and generally fruitlessly) attempt to transform into. It is shown to be able to transform into humans as well; however, it cannot mimic human speech. It transforms into a rock when sleeping to avoid being attacked. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Ditto is known to sleep while still transformed into either a rock or Pok\u00e9mon.[1]On very rare occasions, a sleeping Ditto will transform back to normal when it is relaxed.\nDitto is never far from civilization or people, and is the only Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Metal Powder and Quick Powder items. It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Imposter as an Ability. In The Indigo Disk, various Ditto Blocks[2] can be found as objectives in Blueberry Quests throughout the Terarium, where Ditto will seemingly transform into one of the many cubes with rounded edges that make up many of the structures of the Terarium. Despite being milestones for the player to obtain, and not actually obtainable themselves, they can still be Shiny.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\nDuplica's Ditto transformed into a Pikachu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDitto transformed into a rock while sleeping to avoid being attacked\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Ditto in the form of one of the cubes in Blueberry Academy's Terarium\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\n Ditto in Pok\u00e9mon Ranger: Guardian Signs\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: Ditto appears on the Red Table blocking the Evolution cave, once the Evolution arrows are lit, it moves out of the way, allowing the player to evolve one of the Pok\u00e9mon they have captured.\nPok\u00e9mon Trozei!: Ditto serves as a \"wild card\", meaning it can Trozei with any Pok\u00e9mon and must be used to get rid of Jammer Balls. One will appear when a Trozei is made with more Pok\u00e9mon than necessary and multiple appear at the beginning of a new round in Endless and Forever mode to clear out the remaining Pok\u00e9mon.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky: Ditto is the guardian of Limestone Cavern and its Time Gear.

Players will only find out whether a Pok\u00e9mon is a Ditto if successfully captured, upon which a cutscene will show the Pok\u00e9mon transforming back into Ditto.[4] Ditto can be used in Gym and Raid Battles, in which it will Transform into the first Pok\u00e9mon it sees; however Ditto cannot be used in Trainer Battles.\nAs of September 1, 2021, wild Ditto may be Shiny, and some Pok\u00e9mon whose Shiny forms are available may transform into Ditto. If a player encounters a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon in the wild, it cannot be a disguised Ditto, but non-Shiny Pok\u00e9mon have a small chance of being a Shiny Ditto.[5]\nAs of December 11, 2023, wild Ditto may be disguised as any of the following species:[6]\n\n\nOddish\nKoffing\nRhyhorn\nGoldeen\n\nIn the past, wild Ditto may have also been disguised as these species:[7][8][9][10]\n\n\nWeedle\nPidgey\nRattata\nEkans\nZubat\nParas\nVenonat\nDiglett\nMankey\nGrimer\nGastly\nDrowzee\nVoltorb\nMagikarp\nSentret\nHoothoot\nLedyba\nSpinarak\nNatu\nHoppip\nYanma\nSnubbull\nTeddiursa\nRemoraid\nZigzagoon\nSeedot\nSurskit\nWhismur\nSkitty\nGulpin\nNumel\nCorphish\nStarly\nBidoof\nStunky\nFinneon\nLillipup\nRoggenrola\nTympole\nDwebble\nFoongus\nLitleo\nSwirlix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon Sleep\n\n\n\n\nSleep type: Snoozing\n\nPok\u00e9mon type: Normal\n\nPoints to befriend: 16\n\n\nSpecialty: Ingredients\n\nBerry:Persim Berry \u00d71\n\nPrimary ingredient:Pure Oil \u00d72\n\n\nPossible ingredients:\n\n\nPure Oil\n\nLarge Leek\n\nSlowpoke Tail\n\n\nMain skill: Charge Strength S\n\nBase carry limit: 17\n\n\nIncreases Snorlax's Strength by anywhere from 200 to 800.\n\n\nThere have been reports from around the world of Ditto falling asleep while still transformed into another Pok\u00e9mon.

Ditto fixed that problem near the end of the episode, when it was captured by Team Rocket.\n\nOther\nIn Hello Pummelo, Drake used a Ditto in a Full Battle against Ash at the Pummelo Stadium. It faced Ash's Pikachu, but ended up losing after Pikachu used Agility and then slammed its tail down on Ditto.\nSometime before Imitation Confrontation, Duplica found another Ditto, which she nicknamed Mini-Dit. This second Ditto could transform into an exact mirror image of anything, but it could not change its size.\nIn Unfair Weather Friends, a Ditto was Brodie's partner-in-crime. It reappeared in the same role in The Ribbon Cup Caper.\nA Ditto appeared in PK15.\nIn Dealing With A Fierce Double Ditto Drama!, Narissa used two Ditto nicknamed Ditto 1 and Ditto 2. Ditto 2 is Shiny.\nIn Deceiving Appearances!, five Ditto were getting vaccinated at Aether Paradise. One of them escaped but was soon rescued. One of them reappeared in a flashback in A Masked Warning!. All of them reappeared in Don't Ignore the Small Stufful!.\nIn The Power of Us, Margo befriended a Ditto. It and a Teddiursa were targeted by Pok\u00e9mon hunters looking for Zeraora, but they were saved by Zeraora, Ash, and his friends.\nIn A Talent for Imitation!, a Ditto works as a film actor because Transform is unusually efficient for impersonations. Its latest role was in a movie directed by Kublock, about Gardevoir twins, but it ran away due to Kublock's overly strict attitude and its increasing inability to use Transform as effectively. Ditto eventually ran into and befriended Team Rocket, who taught it how to overcome its nerves and regain its confidence. As a result, it returned to the set and production resumed without any further problems.\n\nMinor appearances\nIn Flower Power, a Ditto was part of Florando's annual Pok\u00e9mon Exhibition.\nIn a flashback in Ignorance is Blissey, a Ditto was at the Pok\u00e9mon Nurse School.\nIn Gonna Rule The School!, the Pok\u00e9mon Trainers' School lent a Ditto to the school's underage students for use in lessons.\nA Ditto appeared in the opening sequence of Lucario and the Mystery of Mew.\nA Ditto appeared in Kalos, Where Dreams and Adventures Begin!.\nA Trainer's Ditto appeared in The First Day of the Rest of Your Life!.\nA Trainer's Ditto appeared in I Choose You!.\nIn The Battlefield of Truth and Love!, a Trainer's Ditto watched the battles of the Manalo Conference.

Finding Ditto appealing, Misty decided to capture one of her own, but the plan was called off when Pikachu went missing.\nDitto was also featured in a minicomic, in which it transformed into Ash, harassed Misty, and thereby got Ash into a lot of pain.\nDitto was the first Pok\u00e9mon Drake used against Ash in The Orange Crew Supreme Gym Leader.\n\nMagical Pok\u00e9mon Journey\nMain article: Master Ditto\nIn Magical Pok\u00e9mon Journey, there is a ninja master named Master Ditto who appears several times in the manga. His first appearance is in The Wal Comes Tumbling Down.\nAdditionally, a group of Ditto appears in Excitement at the Hot Springs?!. The Ditto use Transform to mimic Pikachu and cause mischief.\n\nPocket Monsters HGSS\nRed accidentally caught a Ditto with a Heavy Ball that was originally meant for the legendary beasts in PMHGSS04.\nA Trainer's Ditto appeared in PMHGSS11.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Adventures\n Ditto in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures\nRed, Green & Blue arc\nMain article: Ditty\nIn Tauros the Tyrant, Ditto is one of the members on Green's team. As a master of transformation, Green uses Ditto extensively in her schemes, such as morphing over her face to disguise her appearance (like when she infiltrated the Silph Co. building disguised as Sabrina), camouflaging into its background for subterfuge, as well as forming a protective shield with Green's umbrella.\n\nGold, Silver & Crystal arc\nA Trainer's Ditto appeared in Gligar Glide, where it was seen in the Goldenrod Game Corner.\nDitto is seen later used by Team Rocket in Miltank Melee, to lure Crystal and Eusine away from Suicune and smother them when discovered. It was, however, defeated by Crystal's Hitmonchan, Monlee.\n\nHeartGold & SoulSilver arc\nA Ditto appeared in Out-Odding Oddish, under the ownership of a Pok\u00e9athlon participant.\n\nX & Y arc\nA Ditto appeared in Chesnaught Protects and Charizard Transforms as a resident of the Pok\u00e9mon Village.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys, Whitney owns a Ditto.\n\nPok\u00e9mon: Yeah!

It transformed into a Clefairy so Giovanni could get revenge on Red.\nA Ditto appeared in Part-Time Job At The Swimming Pool!!.\nA Ditto appeared in Pikachu's Birthday Party.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Ruby-Sapphire\nProfessor Oak owns a Ditto, as seen in Annual Big Cleaning Operation!!.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Zensho\nA Ditto first appeared in PZ06, under the ownership of Satoshi.\n\nIn the TCG\nMain article: Ditto (TCG)\nOther appearances\nSuper Smash Bros. Melee\n A screenshot of Ditto in Melee\nDitto was originally intended to be one of the Pok\u00e9mon randomly released from a Pok\u00e9 Ball. It would have transformed into a copy of the user's character and aided them in battle. However, it was removed for unknown reasons before the game's release. Ditto can still be unlocked through the debug menu (which is only accessible through the use of Action Replay), though it does not do anything other than deal 7-8% damage to those who touch it.\nAs for its official status, Ditto only appears as a random trophy and as a cameo in the Tournament Mode menu. In Winner Out or Loser Out tournaments, holding down L and R and pressing A will give the player a random character and color for each match. The usual character image will instead be a picture of Ditto.\n\nTrophy information\nEvery Ditto has the ability to copy a Pok\u00e9mon's entire cell structure in an instant and become its exact replica. They're terrible at remembering techniques, but when they use Transform, they temporarily learn all of their foe's moves. If a Ditto starts to laugh, it weakens and can't hold its transformation.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\n Ditto in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\nDitto appears as a Pok\u00e9mon summoned from the Pok\u00e9 Ball, where it uses Transform to duplicate the shape of the summoning character while still maintaining its own color. It then attacks opposing fighters. Ditto also appears as a Spirit.\n\n\n\n\n\nDitto transformed into an Inkling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDitto attacking in disguise\n\n\n\n\nPOK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu\n Ditto in POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu\n\n\nSpoiler warning: this article may contain major plot or ending details.\n\n\nA Ditto appeared in POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu, under the ownership of Howard Clifford. For the majority of the movie, it assumed a human disguise known as Ms. Norman, but this was eventually uncovered during the final battle at Ryme City.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpoilers end here.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrivia\n Sprite of Animon from the 1997 demo\nDitto has a scrapped Evolution in the 1997 Nintendo Space World demo of Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver named \u30a2\u30cb\u30e2\u30f3 Animon, which evolves from Ditto using a Metal Coat.\nDitto is the only Pok\u00e9mon to date with a catch rate of 35. However, in Generations III and IV, if Ditto transforms into another Pok\u00e9mon, its catch rate will become that of the new Pok\u00e9mon. In Generation IX, its catch rate will become 0 by mistake if the Pok\u00e9mon is not the primary form, gender (for Pok\u00e9mon with differing stats or movesets), or regional form.\nDitto and Manaphy are the only Pok\u00e9mon that are both able to breed yet unobtainable through breeding.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Snap, Ditto takes the form of Bulbasaur in the Cave stage. The player can cause them to return to their Ditto form by hitting them with an object. When the player takes their picture, Ditto has the same eyes when it is transformed as when it is not. This trait is shared by Duplica's Ditto in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Ditto's Mysterious Mansion, although it was understood that this was not natural. Ditto cards from the EX Delta Species TCG expansion, the Clefairy Ditto that may appear in the Veilstone Game Corner's slot machines, and Howard Clifford's Ditto in POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu also have this trait.\nDitto is one of two Pok\u00e9mon to have two different species-specific Stat-enhancing items associated with it, the other being Clamperl. Ditto's two associated items, the Metal Powder and Quick Powder, seem to be the same colors as Ditto's normal and Shiny forms, respectively.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Rumble, since Transform was not programmed into the game, Ditto can only know Struggle. Since PP does not exist in Rumble, this makes Ditto the only Pok\u00e9mon in Rumble that can use Struggle. However, Transform does exist in Pok\u00e9mon Rumble Blast, so Ditto has a move from that game onward.\nDitto is the most common Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Trozei!, appearing in every area. This is due to its ability to transform, enabling the player a way to advance further if no links are available before Ditto appears.\nPrior to Generation VI, Ditto and Poliwag had the same cry.\nSince Transform copies its target's stats (except HP), Ditto cannot utilize its Special Attack stat before Transforming, though it can use its Attack stat for Struggle and confusion damage.\nSince Ditto's only move, Transform, cannot copy moves in the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon series and has only one PP, its only move after transforming is Struggle.\nHowever, in Red/Blue Rescue Team and in Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky, a player-controlled Ditto can learn the TM moves Vacuum-Cut and Wide Slash.\nSince Pok\u00e9mon Super Mystery Dungeon, Ditto is able to get the moveset of the target Pok\u00e9mon when it transforms.\nIn Generation VI, Ditto is only given one move animation (despite the two animations minimum most Pok\u00e9mon have for contact and non-contact moves).\nOn October 4, 2017, The Pok\u00e9mon Company posted a Ditto-themed music video onto their YouTube channel titled Dit-to Ditto.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon GO, Ditto appears in the wild disguised as other Pok\u00e9mon. After being caught, it will reveal its true form. At one point, a large amount of Ditto were seen disguised as the then-unrevealed Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, Meltan.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon GO, Ditto and Shedinja are the only Pok\u00e9mon that cannot be used in Trainer Battles, unless the battle is against Team GO Rocket.\nDitto is the only non-playable Pok\u00e9mon that can be defeated in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Shuffle, Ditto was originally coded as a wildcard prior to its official release, allowing it to match with any other Pok\u00e9mon icon - its effect from Pok\u00e9mon Battle Trozei. This was not a skill effect (as its skill was Swarm), but rather a quality specific to Ditto itself. Some players obtained Ditto illegitimately during this time, and used its effect to gain high scores in competitive stages from September 2015 until Ditto's official release in 2017, when the skill was changed to Shuffle's version of Transform.[11].\nDitto is the only Generation I Pok\u00e9mon that does not have evolutionary relatives (or have a regional variant that does), alternate form (such as Gigantamax or Mega Evolution) or be strongly associated with another that it does not share an evolutionary line with (Mew duo and legendary birds).\nDitto has the most Sleep styles of any Pok\u00e9mon, with a total of 10.\nGlitches\nIndex 000 post-capture\nIn Generation I, if the player manages to capture an 'M (00), it will still be in battle with the player, and the battle will not end. Catching 'M (00) again results in the second one becoming a Ditto of the same level.\n\nTransform glitches\nMain article: List of Transform glitches\nOrigin\n  Bulbanews has an article related to this subject: Unused Pok\u00e9mon design revealed in magazine interview  \nIn the sixth issue of Best Buy's @Gamer magazine, Game Freak developers Junichi Masuda and Ken Sugimori revealed that Ditto was originally based on the iconic smiley face. Its eyes and mouth are exactly like \":)\", which is an emoticon representing the smiley.\nAdditionally, Ditto strongly resembles an amoeba, a single-celled organism with no definite shape. This may emphasize its ability to alter its cellular composition. This could also explain why Ditto is unavailable through breeding, since single-celled organisms reproduce differently from multi-cellular plants and animals. It also could partially be based on an undifferentiated cell, a cell in the body that can change into any other cell by sampling it. In addition, it could have been based on a blob or modeling clay.\nDitto's ability to change into others brings reminescence of variety of mythical creatures like changelings, doppelg\u00e4ngers, or skin-walkers.\n\nName origin\nDitto is literally ditto (that which was stated before; copy of a document; imitation).\nMetamon may be a combination of metamorphose (to undergo a physical transformation) or meta- (prefix meaning \"encompassing\" or \"transcending\", which may refer to Transform allowing Ditto to take on the shape of every other Pok\u00e9mon) and monster.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30e1\u30bf\u30e2\u30f3 Metamon\n\nFrom metamorphose or meta- and monster\n\n\n French\n\nM\u00e9tamorph\n\nFrom m\u00e9tamorphe\n\n\n Spanish\n\nDitto\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nDitto\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Italian\n\nDitto\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uba54\ud0c0\ubabd Metamong\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u767e\u8b8a\u602a / \u767e\u53d8\u602a B\u01ceibi\u00e0ngu\u00e0i\n\nFrom \u767e\u8b8a / \u767e\u53d8 b\u01ceibi\u00e0n and \u602a gu\u00e0i\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u767e\u8b8a\u602a Baakbin'gwaai\n\nFrom \u767e\u8b8a baakbin and \u602a gwaai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d3\u05d9\u05d8\u05d5 Ditto\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0921\u093f\u091f\u094d\u091f\u094b Ditto\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0414\u0438\u0442\u0442\u043e Ditto\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e40\u0e21\u0e15\u0e32\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e19 Metamon\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nDuplica's Ditto\nDitty\nMaster Ditto\nDitto (Pok\u00e9mon Newspaper Strip)\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 Screenshot from the SV website showing a quest with a Ditto Block.\n\n\u2191 A player finding a Shiny Ditto block in the Terarium.\n\n\u2191 Ditto has been discovered... - Pok\u00e9mon GO\n\n\u2191 How Does Shiny Ditto Work in Pok\u00e9mon GO? | Pok\u00e9mon GO Hub\n\n\u2191 (December 1, 2023).
