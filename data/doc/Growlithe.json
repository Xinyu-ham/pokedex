It has orange fur with black stripes along its back and legs. The fur on its muzzle, chest, belly, and tail is beige, as is an additional tuft of fur on top of its head. Growlithe's coat is noticeably longer on its chest and tail. It has gray eyes, a black nose, and large, round and triangular ears with beige interiors. Its forepaws have two visible claws, while its hind paws have three toes each. Each paw has a brown pad.\nGrowlithe is a friendly and loyal Pok\u00e9mon that will fearlessly defend its Trainer and territory from harm, even against larger, stronger enemies. In particular, it has been known to fight with Rockruff over territory. It will fiercely bark at, bite, and chase away any perceived threat. Otherwise, this obedient Pok\u00e9mon will wait motionlessly until given an order. It has a long history with people, as its bones have been found in Stone Age ruins. In the wild, Growlithe can be commonly found in grassy plains.\nGrowlithe also has a powerful olfactory sense. If it detects an unknown smell in its territory, it roars to flush out the intruder. It can smell the emotions of others, and never forgets a scent. However, strong, unpleasant smells can disable Growlithe's sense of smell for short periods, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Case of the K-9 Caper!. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Growlithe is known to bark at anyone who approaches it while sleeping.[1]\n\nForms\nGrowlithe has a regional form: Hisuian Growlithe.\nIn Hisui, Growlithe's fur is dark orange-red, while its mane and tail are light gray, and its muzzle is a light tan. The fur is made out of igneous rock components. Its mane covers its eyes and extends below its head, ending with three curls. Its ears are round and square with light orange-red interiors. It has a small horn made of rock on its head, and its tail is curly.\nGrowlithe's Hisuian form is the result of it being exposed to volcanic activity within the coastal highlands it lives in during Hisui's early times. Hisuian Growlithe's soft and insulated fur allows it to survive the cold weather of Hisui. Although Hisuian Growlithe's horn is made of rock, it is fragile and breaks easily, so the Pok\u00e9mon rarely uses its horn unless needed. Hisuian Growlithe live in pairs, and are known to be vigilant when guarding their territory. Hisuian Growlithe take much longer to bond with humans because they have lived apart from humans for a long time.[2]\n\nEvolution\nGrowlithe evolves into Arcanine.\nHisuian Growlithe evolves into Hisuian Arcanine.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nGrowlithe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nGrowlithe\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nArcanine\u00a0Fire\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHisuian Growlithe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nGrowlitheHisuian Form\u00a0Fire\u00a0\u00a0Rock\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nArcanineHisuian Form\u00a0Fire\u00a0\u00a0Rock\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus: Two Hisuian Growlithe are supporting characters and one being a boss in the game. One of them is the pup of the previous Noble Arcanine, and by extension, a descendant of the Hisuian Arcanine that the Ancient hero had befriended ages ago, and the other one is his friend owned by Palina. Since the previous Lord had died, Arcanine's son later evolved into an Arcanine himself, succeeding his father as the new Noble and being beloved by the people of Hisui region along with the other noble and Ride Pok\u00e9mon.\nPok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet: The Teal Mask: Hisuian Growlithe is a minor character in the games. He's one of the few known Hisuian Growlithe known to be alive in the present. He's owned by Perrin along with his little brother, who's later given to the player.\nDetective Pikachu Returns: Growlithe is one of the Pok\u00e9mon that Detective Pikachu can ride during the game to help him out during a case. She can use her strong sense of smell to track down traces of scent.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #058\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nVery protective of its territory.

Both are Generation I Pok\u00e9mon that evolve once via a Fire Stone. Growlithe is exclusive to Pok\u00e9mon Red, Blue (Japan), Gold, FireRed, and HeartGold while Vulpix is to Green, international Blue, Silver, LeafGreen, and SoulSilver. Growlithe has a 75% chance of being male while Vulpix has a 75% of being female, they are both in the Field Egg Group, can have the Ability Flash Fire, and are yellow when Shiny from Generation III on. Furthermore, both are based primarily on canine-like creatures of Japanese folklore: Growlithe on the shisa, Vulpix on the kitsune.\nGrowlithe shares its category with Lillipup, Rockruff, Yamper, and Fidough. They are all known as the Puppy Pok\u00e9mon.\nHisuian Growlithe shares its category with Sentret and Patrat. They are all known as the Scout Pok\u00e9mon.\nGrowlithe and its evolved form are the only Pok\u00e9mon with a male-female ratio of 3:1 that aren't in the Human-Like Egg Group.\nThrough a glitch in the Generation I games, Pok\u00e9mon that would normally require an Evolution stone to evolve can be evolved without it, provided that the Pok\u00e9mon levels up in the battle and the player has sent out a specific Pok\u00e9mon in the same battle. In the case of the Thunder Stone, this Pok\u00e9mon is Growlithe.\nHisuian Growlithe and its evolved form were designed by Megumi Mizutani.[3]\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus's internal code, Hisuian Growlithe's Hidden Ability is Justified instead of Rock Head.\nHisuian Growlithe and Hisuian Braviary were the first Hisuian forms to be officially revealed.\nOrigin\nGrowlithe may be based on Japanese statues called \u7345\u5b50 shisa that resemble a mix between lions and dogs. They may also originate from Chinese \u7345 sh\u012b or Japanese \u72db\u72ac komainu, which are guardian statues that also resemble lion and dog mixes and are sometimes incorrectly called \"Foo dogs\" in the West. Both shisa and sh\u012b statues alike are often found in pairs, believed to invite good luck, and used as guardians, which may have inspired Growlithe's protective nature. Its stripes and coloration are reminiscent of tigers. It may also draw inspiration from dogs with brindle (\"tiger-striped\") coat patterns, such as the \u7532\u6590\u72ac Kai Ken.\nIn its Hisuian Form, its Rock typing and appearance may be based on the komainu statues.\n\nName origin\nGrowlithe may be a combination of growl and lithe (flexible).\nGardie may refer to its abilities as a guard dog, as a corruption of guard or guardian.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3 Gardie\n\nFrom guardian or guard dog\n\n\n French\n\nCaninos\n\nFrom canine\n\n\n Spanish\n\nGrowlithe\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nFukano\n\nFrom Funke, canis and Vulkan\n\n\n Italian\n\nGrowlithe\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uac00\ub514 Gadi\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5361\u8482\u72d7 K\u01ced\u00ecg\u01d2u\n\nFrom the partial transcription of the Japanese name and \u72d7 g\u01d2u\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5361\u8482\u72d7 K\u0101daig\u00e1u*\u8b77\u4e3b\u72ac Wuhjy\u00fahy\u00fan*\n\nFrom the partial transcription of the Japanese name and \u72d7 g\u01d2uFrom \u8b77\u4e3b\u72ac wuhjy\u00fa-hy\u00fan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0909\u0932\u093f\u0925 Growlithe\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nGraulitas\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0413\u0440\u043e\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0442 Groulit\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e14\u0e35 Kadi\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nGrowlie\nOfficer Jenny's Growlithe\nPartner Pok\u00e9mon (Mystery Dungeon)\nRegional form\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 Hisuian Growlithe | Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus Official Website\n\n\u2191 Tweet by \u6c34\u8c37\u6075 (@megtany).
