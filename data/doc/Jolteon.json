It is covered in yellow fur with a spiky fringe around its tail and a white ruff around its neck. Its ears are large and pointed with black interiors, and its eyes and small nose are black. It has slender legs and small paws, each with three toes and a pink paw-pad.\nJolteon creates electricity using an organ in its lungs, which causes crackling noises as it exhales. It can also generate low-level electricity in its cells, which is amplified by the negative ions it gathers and generates in its fur, allowing it to discharge 10,000-volt lightning bolts. Jolteon's prickly fur is made of electrically charged needles, which create a sparking noise as it moves. It is capable of launching its fur at enemies when agitated or startled; the charge is so powerful that it can remain on the shed fur for a long time. This Pok\u00e9mon is most often found in cities and towns under the ownership of Trainers. However, its high-strung nature and tendency toward mood swings can make it difficult to train. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, the crackling sound of electricity can be heard while Jolteon exhales during its slumber.[1]\n\nEvolution\nJolteon evolves from Eevee.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nEevee\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nJolteon\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #135\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nIt accumulates negative ions in the atmosphere to blast out 10000-volt lightning bolts.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nA sensitive Pok\u00e9mon that easily becomes sad or angry.

It also resembles jackrabbits and other types of hares, or felines such as the serval and the cheetah; the latter is known for being the fastest land animal, which may be alluded to with Jolteon's speed. Its needle-like fur may derive from porcupines, while its ability to launch its fur may be inspired by the myth that porcupines are able to shoot out their quills when threatened.\nAdditionally, Jolteon may have been inspired by the raij\u016b, a beast from Japanese mythology whose body is made of lightning, and may take the form of a dog.\n\nName origin\nJolteon may be a combination of jolt and eon (an immeasurably long period of time, possibly referring to how long evolution takes naturally). Eon is a suffix all Eevee evolutions share and was Eevee's English prototype name.\nThunders is literally thunders.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9 Thunders\n\nFrom thunders\n\n\n French\n\nVoltali\n\nFrom volt and -li (common suffix for all Eeveelutions in French)\n\n\n Spanish\n\nJolteon\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nBlitza\n\nFrom Blitz and -a (common suffix for all Eeveelutions in German)\n\n\n Italian\n\nJolteon\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc96c\ud53c\uc36c\ub354 Jupithunder\n\nFrom Jupiter (Roman god of the sky and thunder) and thunder\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u96f7\u4f0a\u5e03 L\u00e9iy\u012bb\u00f9*\u96f7\u7cbe\u9748 / \u96f7\u7cbe\u7075 L\u00e9ij\u012bngl\u00edng*\n\nFrom \u96f7 l\u00e9i and \u4f0a\u5e03 Y\u012bb\u00f9From \u96f7 l\u00e9i and \u7cbe\u9748 / \u7cbe\u7075 j\u012bngl\u00edng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u96f7\u4f0a\u5e03 L\u00e8uihy\u012bbou*\u96f7\u4f0a\u8c9d L\u00e8uihy\u012bbui*\n\nFrom \u96f7 l\u00e8uih and \u4f0a\u5e03 Y\u012bbouFrom \u96f7 l\u00e8uih and \u4f0a\u8c9d Y\u012bbui\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0925\u0902\u0921\u0930\u0940\u0935\u0940 Thundereevee\n\nFrom thunder and Eevee\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0414\u0436\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0435\u043e\u043d Dzholteon\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e18\u0e31\u0e19\u0e40\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e2a Thandoet\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nVee\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 (2018) EVs.
