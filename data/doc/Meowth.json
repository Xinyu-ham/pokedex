Its ovoid head features four prominent whiskers, wide eyes with slit pupils, two pointed teeth in the upper jaw, and a gold koban coin embedded in its forehead. Its ears are black with brown interiors and are flanked with an additional pair of long whiskers. Meowth is a quadruped with the ability to walk on its hind legs; while the games almost always depict Meowth on two legs, it is stated in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Go West Young Meowth that Meowth normally walks on all fours. It can freely manipulate its claws, retracting them when it wants to move silently. The tip of its tail curls tightly.\nMeowth is attracted to round and shiny objects and has the unique ability to produce coins using its signature move, Pay Day. Meowth and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Pay Day by leveling up. Being nocturnal, it is known to wander about city streets at night and pick up anything that sparkles, including loose change. Upon finding a sparkling object, its eyes will glitter and the coin on its forehead will shine brightly. It shares this intrigue with Murkrow, with whom it often fights with for objects and prey. Meowth is a playful but fickle Pok\u00e9mon with the capacity for human-like intelligence, with at least one member of the species teaching itself how to speak. Meowth tends to live in urban areas. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Meowth is known to sleep with the coins it collects.[1]\n\nForms\nMeowth has a Gigantamax form and two regional forms, Alolan Meowth and Galarian Meowth.\n\nAlolan Meowth\nIn Alola, Meowth has a slightly different look. Alolan Meowth's fur is a light blue-gray color. Instead of brown markings, the tip of its tail, whiskers, digits, and the insides of its ears a whitish-gray. Alolan Meowth's whiskers have a slight curve compared to regular Meowth's straighter whiskers, and it has silvery eyes.\nMeowth was introduced to Alola as a gift to royalty.[2] The luxurious royal lifestyle soon led to Meowth diverging from its origins and becoming the selfish, prideful, and cunning Alolan Meowth. Alolan Meowth will turn hysterical if its coin or pride are besmirched. When the monarchy fell, the rare Alolan Meowth went feral and eventually grew as common in Alola as anywhere else.\n\nGalarian Meowth\nGalarian Meowth has a shaggy, greyish-brown coat resembling a beard, as well as yellow eyes and a toothy grin. Its coin is now black and extremely hard, with the darkest and hardest coins being especially valued and respected among the species.\nGalarian Meowth's body has partially turned to iron as a result of many years of living with a race of savage seafarers. As a result of many battles, Galarian Meowth develops the ability to evolve into Perrserker, instead of Persian. Kantonian Meowth and Galarian Meowth don't get along.\n\nGigantamax Meowth\nSome Kantonian Meowth are capable of Gigantamaxing. As Gigantamax Meowth, it has become larger and longer in size. The body extends from the lower half to the shoulder, while the gold coin gains a symbol. Meowth's eyes change to a glowing gold color. The tail grows long as well, with the end of its tip extending. The tail gets even larger and bumpy when it uses an attack. Three red clouds surround it below the shoulders.\nThe giant coin on Gigantamax Meowth's head emits a lot of Gigantamax power that surrounds the area with a golden gleam. Its desire for shiny objects increases to the point where it will cause damage to skyscraper windows and exterior walls for the sake of sharpening its claws.[3] The symbol on Gigantamax Meowth's gold coin is believed to be the key to unlocking the secrets of Dynamax.\nGigantamax Meowth is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Gold Rush.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGigantamax Meowth\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nMeowth evolves into Persian.\nAlolan Meowth evolves into Alolan Persian.\nGalarian Meowth evolves into Perrserker.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nMeowth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nMeowth\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPersian\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlolan Meowth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nMeowthAlolan Form\u00a0Dark\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPersianAlolan Form\u00a0Dark\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGalarian Meowth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nMeowthGalarian Form\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPerrserker\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: A Meowth appears in a bonus stage that is accessible from the Blue Table.

If it catches you from behind, it can be purralysingly pawerful!\"\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nMeowth returns as a Pok\u00e9 Ball summon, retaining the same behavior as before. It also appears as a Spirit.\n\n\nTrivia\n $1 coins from Niue\n Meowth in Pok\u00e9mon Battle Chess\nNiue released a one-dollar coin featuring Meowth as part of a commemorative promotion for the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, with Meowth on one side and the nation's coat of arms on the other.\nIn Go West, Young Meowth, it was stated that Meowth of Team Rocket had to learn and practice standing on his hind legs like a human, implying that Meowth as a species is not naturally able to stand on their hind legs. However, almost all sprites in the games and the Pok\u00e9dex in Pok\u00e9mon the Series depict it standing on its hind legs, suggesting Meowth has the natural ability to walk on two legs. Tyson's Meowth is also able to walk on two legs, seemingly naturally.\nThe only time Meowth is depicted on all fours in the games is in Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver; when the player places Meowth as the first Pok\u00e9mon in their party, Meowth will walk on four legs behind the player.\nMeowth is the first Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon the Series depicted with the ability to talk.\nMeowth's number in the National Pok\u00e9dex and the Alola Pok\u00e9dex in Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon are the same: 052.\nMeowth is the only Pok\u00e9mon to have regional forms for multiple regions.\nMeowth is the only Pok\u00e9mon to have both a regional form and Gigantamax form.\nMeowth may be considered a counterpart of Mankey. Both of them are Generation I Pok\u00e9mon who evolve into their evolved forms at level 28. Meowth is exclusive to Pok\u00e9mon Blue, Silver, SoulSilver, and Let's Go Eevee!; while Mankey is exclusive to Red, Gold, HeartGold, and Let's Go, Pikachu!. Also, in Black\u00a02 and White\u00a02, Yancy will trade the player a Meowth if the player is male, and Curtis will trade Mankey if the player is female. Additionally, both seem to have a similar color scheme.\nMeowth appears in Pok\u00e9mon Battle Chess. It doesn't behave like any traditional piece in chess.\nIn the original preview for episode 66 of Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series, a Kantonian Meowth was supposed to appear alongside one of the students from Naranja Academy. In the final version of the episode, the respective Pok\u00e9mon was removed, and up until that point, the last appearance of a Kantonian Meowth within the animated series was Team Rocket's Meowth in the Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series episode The Rainbow and the Pok\u00e9mon Master!.\n\n\n\n\nMeowth in Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series\n\n\n\n\nOrigin\n  Bulbanews has an article related to this subject: On the Origin of Species: Meowth  \nMeowth seems to be based upon the Japanese legend of the \u62db\u304d\u732b Maneki-neko, also known as the lucky cat or beckoning cat. According to one legend, a cat raised its paw to welcome a lord and saved his life when a lightning bolt hit the spot where he had been standing. Maneki-neko are often used as charms in restaurants and shops to bring customers fortune and good luck. Statues of the cat are usually depicted holding a koban, an ancient coin used in Japan, like the one on Meowth's head. Meowth's color and pattern suggest that it also draws inspiration from Siamese cats. Its Japanese Pok\u00e9mon category also suggests it is based on a Bakeneko.\nUnlike the normal Meowth, Alolan Meowth appears to be based more on domestic cats that underwent selective breeding, specifically those owned by royalty. In particular, its appearance resembles the \"British Blue\" color variant of the British Shorthair, an imported breed known well for its large and rounded head and pronounced 'smile', which the breed developed through artificial selection as part of the process of developing its pedigree.\nBased on its appearance and Sword Pok\u00e9dex entry, Galarian Meowth may be based on Norwegian Forest cats, large fluffy cats with beard-like ruffs, or European Wildcats, with traits of the Vikings that kept the breed's presumed ancestors on their ships.\nGigantamax Meowth's elongated body may be based on a sketch from Monty Python's Flying Circus about a giant cat with outstretched arms and the longcat meme.\n\nName origin\nMeowth may be a combination of meow (the sound a cat makes), mouth, and wealth, alluding to the Maneki-neko's capacity to bring good fortune. The -th may also be borrowed from Nyarth, as both meow and ny\u0101 are onomatopoeia of a cat's cry.\nNyarth may be a play on \u30cb\u30e3\u30fc ny\u0101 (the sound a cat makes in Japanese).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30cb\u30e3\u30fc\u30b9 Nyarth\n\nFrom \u30cb\u30e3\u30fc ny\u0101\n\n\n French\n\nMiaouss\n\nFrom miaou, ouste and -ss\n\n\n Spanish\n\nMeowth\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nMauzi\n\nFrom miau, mauzen and Mieze\n\n\n Italian\n\nMeowth\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub098\uc639 Naong\n\nFrom a corruption of \uc57c\uc639 yaong\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u55b5\u55b5 Mi\u0101omi\u0101o*\u55b5\u8c93 / \u55b5\u732b Mi\u0101om\u0101o*\n\nFrom \u55b5 mi\u0101oFrom \u55b5 mi\u0101o and \u8c93 m\u0101o\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u55b5\u55b5 M\u0113um\u0113u*\u55b5\u55b5\u602a M\u0113um\u0113ugwaai*\n\nFrom \u55b5 m\u012buFrom \u55b5 m\u012bu and \u602a gwaai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05de\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5 Miau\n\nFrom \u05de\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5 miau\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092e\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0909\u0925 Meowth\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Indonesian\n\nMeowthMiawthNyasu\n\nSame as English nameSimilar to English nameTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nMiau\n\nFrom miau\n\n\n Polish\n\nMeowth\n\nSame as English name.
