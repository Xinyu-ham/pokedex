Its fur is pale tan with the exception of its black-rimmed ears. It has a short muzzle with a small, black nose, red eyes with slit pupils, rounded ears, a pair of pointed teeth in its upper jaw, and three whiskers on either side of its face. Its thick whiskers are very sensitive to changes in air movements, enabling it to detect its prey by movement alone. In the center of its forehead is a red jewel. Its long tail has a distinctive curl at the end. Persian communicates with body language and holds its tail upright to signal its intention to pounce. It has long legs and three-toed paws with retractable claws. Persian's lithe muscles also enable it to walk without making a sound.\nPersian normally lives in towns and cities. Although popular for its elegance, it is extremely difficult to raise as a pet due to its fickle and temperamental personality. It will scratch anyone, including its Trainer, with little or no provocation, and has been observed ripping its prey apart for no discernible reason. However, when Persian is yanked by its whiskers, it becomes temporarily docile for unknown reasons. It is popular among rich people and is targeted by hunters for its jewel. Its relationship with Perrserker is one of mutual disdain, as Persian's refined and elegant personality clashes with Perrserker's barbaric nature. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Persian is known to clean and groom itself even when asleep.[1] Even when asleep, Persian maintains its striking and haughty expression.\nPersian and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Pay Day by leveling up.\n\nForms\nPersian has a regional form: Alolan Persian.\nAlolan Persian has a body that is similar to its regular counterpart, but it has blue-gray fur. Its face has a different shape, being larger and more rounded with noticeable jowls. This distinctive face, along with its high-class softer-than-velvet fur coat, is admired by the people of Alola. Its eyes are usually in a half-closed state, and instead of a red forehead jewel, it has a blue jewel. The jewel, though different in appearance, is made of mostly the same material the one on a regular Persian. In behavior, it is described as highly intelligent and having an even higher opinion of itself. It prefers to use underhanded tactics in battle, but its haughty personality causes it to underestimate opponents.\nIn Generation IX, Alolan Persian is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Fur Coat as an Ability.\n\nEvolution\nPersian evolves from Meowth.\nAlolan Persian evolves from Alolan Meowth.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nPersian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nMeowth\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPersian\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlolan Persian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nMeowthAlolan Form\u00a0Dark\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPersianAlolan Form\u00a0Dark\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Persian runs the bank at Pok\u00e9mon Square.\nPok\u00e9mon Super Mystery Dungeon: The aforementioned Persian returns as an acquaintance of the Duskull from Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness and is recruited once Duskull connects with player.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #053\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nAlthough its fur has many admirers, it is tough to raise as a pet because of its fickle meanness.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nThe gem in its forehead glows on its own!

It also appears similar to Siamese cats and its species in Japanese is \u30b7\u30e3\u30e0\u30cd\u30b3 or \"shamuneko\" meaning \"Siamese Cat\". The gem on its head makes it resemble a Carbuncle, a Latin American mythological beast that had a jewel on its forehead.\nUnlike Kantonian Persian, Alolan Persian appears to be based more on domestic cats that underwent selective breeding, specifically those owned by royalty. In particular, its appearance greatly resembles a British Shorthair, an imported breed known well for its large and rounded head and pronounced 'smile', which the breed developed through artificial selection as part of the process of developing its pedigree. Its blue jewel and gray fur may be a visual pun on the \"British Blue\" color variant. Due to its large head and mannerisms, it may also be a visual pun on the term of being \"big-headed\".\n\nName origin\nPersian may refer to Persian cats or possibly Persian leopards. It could also be related to purr, the onomatopoeia for the noise a cat makes when content.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30da\u30eb\u30b7\u30a2\u30f3 Persian\n\nFrom Persian\n\n\n French\n\nPersian\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Spanish\n\nPersian\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n German\n\nSnobilikat\n\nFrom Snob, nobilis, and Katze\n\n\n Italian\n\nPersian\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ud398\ub974\uc2dc\uc628 Persion\n\nTranscription of Japanese name and possibly lion\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u8c93\u8001\u5927 / \u732b\u8001\u5927 M\u0101ol\u01ceod\u00e0\n\nFrom \u8c93 / \u732b m\u0101o and \u8001\u5927 l\u01ceod\u00e0\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u8c93\u8001\u5927 M\u0101aul\u00f3uhdaaih*\u9ad8\u7ac7\u8c93 G\u014dudaum\u0101au*\n\nFrom \u8c93 m\u0101au and \u8001\u5927 l\u00f3uhdaaihFrom \u9ad8\u7ac7\u8c93 g\u014dudaum\u0101au\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Danish\n\nPersianer*\n\nFrom Persian, though the word itself refers to a karakul pelt\n\n\n Finnish\n\nPersialainen\n\nLiterally \"Persian\"\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092a\u0930\u094d\u0936\u093f\u092f\u0928 Persian\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nPersijanas\n\nFrom English name\n\n\n Brazilian Portuguese\n\nPersa\n\nLiterally \"Persian\"\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0430\u043d Persian\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0441 Pers\n\nTranscription of English nameLiterally \"Persian\"\n\n\n Swedish\n\nPersen*\n\nFrom pers, persian\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19 Poesian\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nGiovanni's Persian\nRegional form\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\nExternal links\n\n Alolan forms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: Regional forms (Alolan \u2022 Galarian \u2022 Hisuian \u2022 Paldean) \u2022 Ecologically similar Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0052: Meowth\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0054: Psyduck\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Persian_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128026\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monNormal-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monDark-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupYellow-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 08 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with different formsField group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 440Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became both Special Attack and Special DefensePok\u00e9mon whose base Speed stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon with 18 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monBlue-colored Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 12:57.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
