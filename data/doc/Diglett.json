Its small stature makes it both the lightest and shortest Ground type. It has beady black eyes and a large, round, pink nose. A Diglett in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team mentions that it has feet, though their size and appearance are unknown. It spends much of its time underground and has very thin skin. If Diglett is exposed to sunlight, its blood will heat up and cause it to grow weak.\nDiglett lives in tunnels and caves under the earth, where it feeds on tree roots and vegetables. It is known to live in burrows left behind by Onix. It also sometimes lives in burrows near forests and has even been shown to live inside of trees. Diglett digs regularly through the earth at a shallow depth, leaving perfectly tilled soil in its wake. Some farmers welcome Diglett because it tills their fields and its droppings enrich the soil, but others consider it a pest for eating their vegetables. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Diglett is known to sleep underground during the night. Seeing a Diglett asleep above ground is considered to be good luck.[1]\nIn Generation II, Diglett and its evolved form, Dugtrio, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Fissure.\n\nForms\nDiglett has a regional form: Alolan Diglett.\nIn Alola, Diglett has developed three fine gold whiskers on its head from living in soil with high iron content. These whiskers function as sensors and allow it to monitor its surroundings without coming above ground, though it will still occasionally poke its head out to see outside. The whiskers can also be used for communication, wobbling around to relay mood or emotion. They stand straight up for anger, swing around for happiness, and droop for sadness.[2] Needing to be able to dig through Alola's volcanic rock, Alolan Diglett is notably stronger than its non-Alolan counterparts. However, they are still very small, tying with Klefki and Meltan as the shortest Steel-type. They can also be found in the Coastal Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated.\nAlolan Diglett and its evolution are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Tangling Hair as an Ability.\nDespite Diglett having a strong resemblance to Wiglett from the Paldea region, the two Pok\u00e9mon species are not biologically related, having entirely separate diets and habitats.[3] Their resemblance to each other is said to be a coincidental result of adaptations to their respective environments.[4]\n\nEvolution\nDiglett evolves into Dugtrio.\nAlolan Diglett evolves into Alolan Dugtrio.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nDiglett\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nDiglett\u00a0Ground\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nDugtrio\u00a0Ground\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlolan Diglett\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nDiglettAlolan Form\u00a0Ground\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nDugtrioAlolan Form\u00a0Ground\u00a0\u00a0Steel\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield - The Isle of Armor: There is a side quest where the player is tasked with finding 150 Alolan Diglett scattered throughout the Isle of Armor.\nPok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl: Diglett and Dugtrio can be found roaming the halls of the Grand Underground. When 40 Diglett (or Dugtrio, which counts as 3) have been found, all players in the same Grand Underground session will receive a variety of bonuses for a period of 4 minutes. These include raising the odds of finding a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon in a Pok\u00e9mon Hideaway from 1/4096 to 1/2048, and forcing all Stone Boxes found when mining to become Pretty Stone Boxes.\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: Numerous Diglett appear in a bonus stage accessible from the Red Table, where the aim is to knock all the Diglett out. Once achieved a Dugtrio appears which must be knocked out. More Diglett appear on the Red Table itself and earn the player points upon being hit.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team: The third story mission of the game is to rescue a Diglett from Mt. Steel. Afterwards, Diglett can be found near Pelipper Post Office. Diglett's hero is its father, Dugtrio, who it thinks can do anything.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness: Diglett is one of the members of Wigglytuff Guild. His primary role is sentry duty, to examine visitors' footprints and say what Pok\u00e9mon they are. Like in the first game, Diglett also has a father who it thinks can swim in the sea.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX: A group of Diglett will accidentally burrow their way to the player's home from the Pelipper Post Office. As an apology, the player is given free access to use the tunnel to immediately go to the post office directly from their home.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #050\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nLives about one yard underground where it feeds on plant roots.

They are all known as the Mole Pok\u00e9mon.\nAt the Heahea City Game Freak office in Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon, Shigeki Morimoto states that he made up Diglett when he was a little kid.\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue beta, Diglett was originally to use its Japanese name, \"Digda\", as its English name. This name was retained in the German localization of the games.\nDiglett and Alolan Diglett have the lowest base HP and Defense stats of all Ground-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nAlolan Diglett has the lowest base HP and Defense stats of all Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon the Series, Gary claims Diglett is able to pull its head underground faster than the speed of light. In the English dub, this is changed to simply at the speed of light.\nDiglett is listed in Pok\u00e9mon Stadium as having Acid as a valid move, despite not being able to learn the move.[5]\nDespite being the only species seen within the halls of the Grand Underground in Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, Diglett and Dugtrio cannot actually be caught or traditionally encountered in any of the Pok\u00e9mon Hideaways.\nDesign quirks\n Diglett mentioning having feet in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team and their remake, after the first Mt. Steel mission, Diglett mentions having feet. It is mentioned again as being one of the seven mysteries of Pok\u00e9mon in a letter, alongside Arbok's pattern changes and the inside of Forretress's shell.\nIts ability to learn moves like Scratch, Hone Claws and Slash imply it has claws on its hands and feet. This also applies to its Alolan counterpart who can learn Metal Claw. Furthermore, its ability to learn Body Slam implies that it has a body large enough to use the attack.\nDue to being embedded in the ground, Diglett and Dugtrio have special interactions with certain mechanics in the Pok\u00e9mon games.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, if Diglett is the player's partner Pok\u00e9mon, and the player goes to the Pok\u00e9mon Center, Diglett jumps to its Pok\u00e9 Ball to be healed.\nIn the Pok\u00e9athlon, Diglett and Dugtrio are unable to jump. In Hurdle Dash, they dig under hurdles instead of jumping them, in Lamp Jump they cannot move, and in Disc Catch they can only move but not jump to catch the discs.\nSince Generation V, when Diglett and Dugtrio are sent out, they merely fade onto the screen instead of dropping down like all other Pok\u00e9mon.\nIn the Pok\u00e9 Transfer, Diglett and Dugtrio run between bushes rather than jump.\nOn the \"Compare\" screen of Pok\u00e9mon X and Y's Pok\u00e9dex, if the player taps the menu sprite of Diglett, Dugtrio, or Mega Gengar, the Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon will give up and disperse before even trying to lift it.\nDiglett, Dugtrio, Sandygast, Palossand, and Mega Gengar are immune to Telekinesis. However, a Pok\u00e9mon transformed into one of these can be affected by Telekinesis.\nIf a Z-Move animation, such as Supersonic Skystrike, results in showing Diglett or Dugtrio in the air, it is shown still embedded in the ground.\nHurricane will not lift Diglett or Dugtrio off the ground in the Generation VI animation like it does with other Pok\u00e9mon.\nSince version 0.177.1 (Android)/1.143.1 (iOS) of Pok\u00e9mon GO, Diglett will not float in the air when it is evolved into Dugtrio, unlike other Pok\u00e9mon.[6]\nOrigin\nDiglett appears to be based on an artificial mole used in the Whac-A-Mole arcade games. This is referenced by its full health phrase in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team, \"Please don't whack me on the head!\".\nAlolan Diglett's hair may be based on Pele's hair, a thin volcanic glass formed near Hawaiian volcanoes. The darker soil surrounding its body may be a reference to black sand, which is found on beaches near volcanoes. Its Steel type may be a reference to another kind of magnetic black sand found in placer deposits.\n\nName origin\nDiglett may be a combination of dig and the suffix -let (indicating small size).\nDigda may be derived from dig.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30c7\u30a3\u30b0\u30c0 Digda\n\nFrom dig\n\n\n French\n\nTaupiqueur\n\nFrom taupe and marteau-piqueur\n\n\n Spanish\n\nDiglett\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nDigda\n\nSame as Japanese name\n\n\n Italian\n\nDiglett\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub514\uadf8\ub2e4 Digda\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5730\u9f20 D\u00ecsh\u01d4\n\nFrom \u5730 d\u00ec, \u9f20 sh\u01d4, and \u5730\u9f20 d\u00ecsh\u01d4\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5730\u9f20 Deihsy\u00fa\n\nFrom \u5730 deih, \u9f20 sy\u00fa, and \u5730\u9f20 deihsy\u00fa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d3\u05d9\u05d2\u05dc\u05d8 Diglet\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0921\u093f\u0917\u0932\u0947\u091f Diglett\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nDigletas\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0414\u0438\u0433\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0442 Diglett\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e14\u0e34\u0e01\u0e14\u0e32 Dikda\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nRegional form\nWiglett\nEcologically similar Pok\u00e9mon\nPok\u00e9mon fusion\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Diglett\n\n\u2191 World Pok\u00e9mon Ecological Society\n\n\u2191 Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet site | Wiglett\n\n\u2191 Pok\u00e9mon Stadium (International) - The Cutting Room Floor\n\n\u2191 (June 17, 2020). \"Now Diglett evolves respectfully on the ground!\" Reddit (r/TheSilphRoad).\n\n\nExternal links\n\n Alolan forms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: Regional forms (Alolan \u2022 Galarian \u2022 Hisuian \u2022 Paldean) \u2022 Ecologically similar Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\nEcologically similar Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also:Regional forms (Alolan \u2022 Galarian \u2022 Hisuian \u2022 Paldean)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0049: Venomoth\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0051: Dugtrio\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Diglett_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128879\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monGround-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monSteel-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupBrown-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 05 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with different formsField group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 265Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 16 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 16:29.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
