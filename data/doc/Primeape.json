There is usually a throbbing vein on the left side of its forehead, and it has triangular ears with pink insides, narrow eyes with tiny pupils, and a pink, snout-like nose. Its arms and legs are brown and have metal shackles on the wrists and ankles. This is probably indicative of a method of training with weights. The hands have no visible fingers, instead resembling mittens or boxing gloves, and the feet have two toes.\nPrimeape is easily angered; even the slightest glance of eye contact will make it furious. When it becomes enraged, its blood circulation is boosted. This makes its muscles stronger, but at the cost of some of its intelligence. Primeape also possesses the ability to convert its anger into energy to attack its opponents with. It has sturdy vessels in its brain that keep it healthy despite its constant anger. It will chase anyone who upsets it and will not stop until it has caught up to its target. Even if it is awoken from sleep, it will groggily chase whatever woke it. Some researchers have a theory Primeape is angry even when inside a Pok\u00e9 Ball. In some cases, Primeape has been known to die as a result of its rage, though it is also said to look peaceful in death, potentially due to its rage transcending and leaving its physical form to become something new. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Showdown at the Po-k\u00e9 Corral, it is shown to have a fondness for bananas. Primeape can be found on mountains. It competes with Ursaring when it comes to searching for berries. In Paldea, Hawlucha is Primeape's natural enemy. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, it is very rare to find a Primeape sleeping without rage, possibly from exhausting itself.[1]\nPrimeape and its evolved form, Annihilape, are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Rage Fist.\n\nEvolution\nPrimeape evolves from Mankey and evolves into Annihilape.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nMankey\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPrimeape\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nAnnihilape\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\u00a0Ghost\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #057\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nAlways furious and tenacious to boot.

This affirmation, however, has been contradicted several times: the most notable instance of this is in Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus, where Primeape is unobtainable, and Pok\u00e9 Balls with the same function and shape, albeit made with seemingly different materials, are seen in Hisui at an early point in history.\nOrigin\nPrimeape's categorization as the \"Pig Monkey Pok\u00e9mon\" along with its pig-like nose, may be inspired by the Southern pig-tailed macaque. It also shares a similar color scheme and shaggy fur with this primate. Given its long tail, habitat, and overall personality, Primeape has much in common with baboons and snub-nosed monkeys.\nIn addition, Primeape's hands look like boxing gloves and it appears to be wearing metal weights on its wrists and ankles.\n\nName origin\nPrimeape may be a combination of prime, primate, and ape.\nOkorizaru may be derived from \u6012\u308a\u733f okorizaru (angry monkey).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30aa\u30b3\u30ea\u30b6\u30eb Okorizaru\n\nFrom \u6012\u308a\u733f okorizaru\n\n\n French\n\nColossinge\n\nFrom colosse and singe\n\n\n Spanish\n\nPrimeape\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nRasaff\n\nFrom rasend and Affe\n\n\n Italian\n\nPrimeape\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc131\uc6d0\uc22d Seongwonsung\n\nFrom \uc131\ub098\ub2e4 seongnada and \uc6d0\uc22d\uc774 wonsung-i\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u706b\u7206\u7334 / \u706b\u66b4\u7334 Hu\u01d2b\u00e0oh\u00f3u\n\nFrom \u706b hu\u014f, \u706b\u7206 / \u706b\u66b4 hu\u014fb\u00e0o, \u7206 b\u00e0o, and \u7334 h\u00f3u\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u706b\u7206\u7334 F\u00f3baauh\u00e0uh\n\nFrom \u706b f\u00f3, \u706b\u7206 f\u00f3baau, \u7206 baau, and \u7334 h\u00e0uh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05e4 Praymip\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0907\u092e\u0947\u092a Primeape\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nPuikioji Be\u017ed\u017eion\u0117\n\nFrom puikus and be\u017ed\u017eion\u0117\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041f\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0435\u0439\u043f Praymeyp\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e42\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e04\u0e23\u0e34\u0e0b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e38 Okhorisaru\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\nSee also\nAsh's Primeape\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0056: Mankey\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0058: Growlithe\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Primeape_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4148203\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monFighting-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupBrown-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 06 Pok\u00e9monField group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kitakami Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 455Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon whose base Attack stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon with 15 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monShadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XDPok\u00e9mon that are included in the Japan-only Pok\u00e9mon StadiumPok\u00e9mon with cross-generational Evolutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 18 October 2024, at 00:41.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
