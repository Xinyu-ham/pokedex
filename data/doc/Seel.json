It has a pale tan maw with a large red tongue and a pair of tusks on its lower jaw. It has circular eyes and a black nose that is capable of closing when it swims. There is a small horn on its forehead, which it uses in combination with its tusks to bore through ice floes. It has two flippers on its chest, and two more on the end of its tail. When the tail is raised, it resembles a waterspout.\nSeel lives on icebergs in frigid ocean waters. Its warm fur and thick hide allow it to swim in waters as cold as -40\u00b0 Fahrenheit (-40\u00b0 Celsius). It thrives in these cold environments, becoming more active as the temperature drops and tires easily in warm waters. Preferring to sleep during the day, it hunts for prey under sheets of ice in the late day and evening hours. While it is a graceful swimmer, it is awkward and struggles to move on dry land.\n\nEvolution\nSeel evolves into Dewgong.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nSeel\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nDewgong\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Ice\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: A Seel appears in a bonus stage accessible from the Blue Table.

After the second half of Venusaur is revealed, the screen moves continually to the right without stopping and so fighting does not stay on Seel for very long.\n\nTrivia\nSeel shares its category with Dewgong and Popplio. They are all known as the Sea Lion Pok\u00e9mon.\nSeel is the only non-Ice-type Pok\u00e9mon that can have Ice Body as its Ability. Consequently, Seel is the only Pok\u00e9mon with Ice Body to benefit from its hail immunity, since all other Pok\u00e9mon with the Ability are naturally immune to hail damage due to their typing.\nOrigin\nSeel may be based on an earless seal, particularly a harp seal pup due to its white fur and icy habitat. It also shares characteristics with other aquatic mammals that live in the Arctic Ocean. Its long, white body is similar to a beluga whale, its horn may be inspired by a narwhal, and its tusks may be inspired by a walrus. The shape of its tail resembles a stylized waterspout or geyser.\n\nName origin\nSeel is derived from seal.\nPawou may be derived from an onomatopoeia of a seal's bark.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30d1\u30a6\u30ef\u30a6 Pawou\n\nFrom the onomatopoeia of a seal's bark\n\n\n French\n\nOtaria\n\nFrom otarie\n\n\n Spanish\n\nSeel\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nJurob\n\nFrom jung and Robbe\n\n\n Italian\n\nSeel\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc96c\uc96c Juju\n\nFrom junior or \uc96c\ub808\uace4 Juregon\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5c0f\u6d77\u7345 / \u5c0f\u6d77\u72ee Xi\u01ceoh\u01ceish\u012b\n\nFrom \u5c0f xi\u01ceo and \u6d77\u7345 / \u6d77\u72ee h\u01ceish\u012b\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5c0f\u6d77\u7345 S\u00eduh\u00f3is\u012b\n\nFrom \u5c0f s\u00edu and \u6d77\u7345 h\u00f3is\u012b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0938\u0940\u0938\u0940\u0932 Seaseal\n\nFrom sea and seal or Seel\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0421\u0438\u043b Sil\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e40\u0e27\u0e32 Phaowao\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nSeel (Cerulean Gym)\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0085: Dodrio\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0087: Dewgong\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Seel_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4134791\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monWater-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupWhite-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 03 Pok\u00e9monWater 1 group Pok\u00e9monField group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Unova Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 325Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 15 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monShadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 30 September 2024, at 12:16.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
