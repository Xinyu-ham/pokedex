On top of its head are three thick strands of black hair, and it has a wide, flat cream-colored beak. Psyduck's eyes seem vacant and have tiny pupils. Its legs and tail are stubby, and it has cream-colored webbed feet. There are three claws on each of its hands.\nPsyduck is constantly stunned by its headache and is unable to think very clearly. It usually stands immobile, trying to calm its headache. However, when its headache becomes too severe, Psyduck releases tension in the form of strong psychic powers. The use of these powers produces brain waves identical to those seen in sleepers, and the Pok\u00e9mon is unable to recall these episodes. Psyduck lives in freshwater lakes and small ponds, but can be seen in rivers in tropical areas as shown in Pok\u00e9mon Snap. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Psyduck suffers headaches while it sleeps.[1] Very rarely, their sights are Psyduck sleeping peacefully while not holding its head.\nPrior to Generation V, Psyduck and its evolved form, Golduck, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Cloud Nine as an Ability.\n\nEvolution\nPsyduck evolves into Golduck.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nPsyduck\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nGolduck\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: A Psyduck appears on the Blue Table, and earns the player points when it is hit.\nPok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl, Platinum, and Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl: A group of Psyduck can be found blocking the northern fork of Route 210. After the player obtains the Badges in Veilstone City and Pastoria City, Cynthia will hand over a Secret Medicine to cure their headaches.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #054\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nWhile lulling its enemies with its vacant look, this wily Pok\u00e9mon will use psychokinetic powers.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nAlways tormented by headaches.

Despite being generally shown as dimwitted and oblivious, when its headache gets bad enough, it has been shown to use phenomenally powerful Psychic-type moves, which far exceed its normal ability.\n\nOther\nIn Bye Bye Psyduck, Marina owns a Psyduck. It wasn't as dopey as the Psyduck Misty had, and even proved itself to be rather strong in battle, managing to defeat Staryu. However, it lost against a wild Golduck that Misty used under the belief that her Psyduck had evolved into it.\nIn Mewtwo Strikes Back, a Psyduck was cloned from Misty's Psyduck. It then participated in the battle between the original Pok\u00e9mon and the cloned Pok\u00e9mon. Psyduck reappeared in Mewtwo Returns.\nIn Sitting Psyduck, Emily had a Psyduck that persistently escaped from her mansion because it didn't like the lavish life she gave it.\nIn Not on MY Watch Ya Don't!, Team Rocket used a Psyduck as part of their scheme.\nIn The Psyduck Stops Here!, eleven Psyduck (three newly hatched) lived by a pond. Three of the Psyduck were blocking the path that Ash and his friends needed to pass on their way to Celestic Town. Ash and friends later discovered that they were living by the pond because nearby Lake Psyduck had been invaded by a trio of Muk. Ash and friends later evicted the Muk and allowed the Psyduck to live by Lake Psyduck so that the Psyduck's road blocking days can come to an end.\nIn Raid Battle in The Ruins!, Shane Seeker owns a Shiny Psyduck, which is his first and main Pok\u00e9mon. Psyduck was used in a Raid Battle against a giant Golurk.\nA Trainer's Psyduck using a scarf, appeared in Memories of a Warming Kindness!.
