It is primarily brown with a cream-colored face, underside, and flight feathers. On top of its head is a short crest of three tufts. The center crest feathers are brown, and the outer two tufts are cream-colored. Just under its crest are its narrow eyes, which have white sclera and pupil and black irises. Angular black markings extend from behind its eyes and continue down its cheeks. It has a short, stubby beak and feet with two toes in front and one in back. Both its beak and feet are a grayish-pink. It has a short, brown tail made of three feathers.\nPidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction and homing instincts. It can travel straight back to its nest regardless of how far away it might have flown. It is a docile Pok\u00e9mon and prefers to flee from its enemies rather than fight them. Flapping its wings rapidly can whip up dust clouds and create whirlwinds to protect itself and flush out potential prey. Pidgey is common throughout its range and can often be seen in meadows and temperate forests. Ekans and Sneasel are natural predators of Pidgey. Pidgey preys on Seedot.\nIn Generation III, Feather Dance was its signature move, though other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding.\n\nEvolution\nPidgey evolves into Pidgeotto, which evolves into Pidgeot.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nPidgey\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nPidgeotto\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nPidgeot\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness: Pidgey and Seedot are the members of Team Seedgey.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #016\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nA common sight in forests and woods.

They are all known as the Tiny Bird Pok\u00e9mon, though Natu has also been called the Little Bird Pok\u00e9mon.\nPidgey is the only Pok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 251.\nPidgey has the shortest cry of any Pok\u00e9mon, being only 0.181 seconds long.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon the Series, Pidgey is often erroneously depicted with four talons on each foot, as opposed to three.\nOrigin\nDespite its name, Pidgey more closely resembles various passerine birds (especially the female house sparrow) than it does a pigeon. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Carrying On! features \"carrier-Pidgey\" and references \"Pidgey Mail\", which is an allusion to homing pigeons, also known as carrier pigeons. The black markings around its eyes are reminiscent of Ra and Horus, the sun and sky gods of Egyptian mythology who were depicted with the heads of falcons.\n\nName origin\nPidgey may be a corruption of pigeon or a combination of budgie, chickadee, and pudgy (small and plump).\nPoppo may be derived from \u307d\u3063\u307d poppo (onomatopoetic sound of a pigeon's coo).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30dd\u30c3\u30dd Poppo\n\nFrom \u307d\u3063\u307d poppo\n\n\n French\n\nRoucool\n\nFrom roucouler and cool\n\n\n Spanish\n\nPidgey\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nTaubsi\n\nFrom Taube\n\n\n Italian\n\nPidgey\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uad6c\uad6c Gugu\n\nFrom \uad6c\uad6c gugu\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u6ce2\u6ce2 B\u014db\u014d\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u6ce2\u6ce2 B\u014db\u014d\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05e4\u05d9\u05d3\u05d2'\u05d9 Pidji\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092a\u093f\u091c\u0940 Pidgey\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nPid\u017eis\n\nFrom English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041f\u0438\u0434\u0436\u0438 Pidzhi\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e42\u0e1b\u0e30 Poppo\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nOrville\nGold's Pidgey\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0015: Beedrill\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0017: Pidgeotto\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Pidgey_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128833\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monNormal-type Pok\u00e9monFlying-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Slow experience groupBrown-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 09 Pok\u00e9monFlying group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 251Pok\u00e9mon with a unique base stat totalPok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became both Special Attack and Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 20 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 16:28.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
