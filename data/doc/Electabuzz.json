It has antennae with bulbous tips where its ears should be, two long tufts of fur on top of its head, small eyes, and two large fangs in its upper jaw. It is covered in yellow fur with many black stripes. There is a large, lightning bolt-shaped stripe on Electabuzz's chest, a V-shaped stripe on its forehead, one stripe on its side, a thick stripe down its back, two bands on each leg, several broken bands on each arm, and many rings around its long tail. There are three clawed toes on each of its feet, two in front and one in back, and five fingers on each hand.\nIn the dark, Electabuzz will glow light blue from the electrical charges running across its body. It is constantly leaking more electricity than it consumes. Bearing near an Electabuzz will cause a human's hair to stand on end. Electabuzz often gathered groups around tall trees to wait for the upcoming storm. During torrential thunderstorms, Electabuzz will compete to find locations likely to be struck by lightning to absorb the electric power. Electabuzz is often used as an alternative to lightning rods because it is unharmed by the absorption of electricity. It is also capable of entirely nonverbal communication via electrical currents when near another of its species. Blackouts have been known to happen when groups of Electabuzz gather to consume electricity from power plants, they often get blamed for the occurring power outages. As a result, Ground-type Pok\u00e9mon are kept around power plants to keep Electabuzz from raiding, although the blackouts are usually the fault of the electric companies, not Electabuzz. There is ongoing research on using Electabuzz to store away lightning until it is needed to be used later.\nAs demonstrated in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Showdown at Dark City, Electabuzz is sent into a rage by the color red. In battle, Electabuzz windmills its arms, apparently to add momentum to its punches. This method of battle seems ineffective, as opponents can escape in the meantime. Electabuzz typically resides near power plants and can cause blackouts in cities, though it can also be found in grasslands.\n\nEvolution\nElectabuzz evolves from Elekid and evolves into Electivire.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nElekid\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nElectabuzz\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nElectivire\u00a0Electric\u00a0\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #125\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nNormally found near power plants, they can wander away and cause major blackouts in cities.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nIf a major power outage occurs, it is certain that this Pok\u00e9mon has eaten electricity at a power plant.\n\n\nStadium \n\nAppear in power plants in search of electricity.

Surge.\n\nIn the TCG\nMain article: Electabuzz (TCG)\nTrivia\nIn English, the category \"Electric Pok\u00e9mon\" is shared by Elekid, Electabuzz, and Kantonian Zapdos.\nIn Japanese, Elekid has the category \u3067\u3093\u304d\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3 Denki Pok\u00e9mon (Electric Pok\u00e9mon), while the other two Pok\u00e9mon share the category \u3067\u3093\u3052\u304d\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3 Dengeki Pok\u00e9mon (Electric Shock Pok\u00e9mon).\nMagmar and Electabuzz seem to be counterparts; both evolve in a very similar way (first at level 30, then after being traded holding an item which has a name that ends with the suffix \"-izer\"), both have the same gender ratio (75% male, 25% female), and both are typically exclusive to one version of a pair of games. They both have similar status-inducing Abilities in Flame Body and Static, as well as the same Hidden Ability, Vital Spirit. Since Generation V, they also often learn similar moves at the same level. They even have the same special moves when purified in Pok\u00e9mon XD: Follow Me and Cross Chop. Their evolutionary relatives were released in the same generation (Generation II and IV). Both also appear to be based on beings from Japanese mythology; Electabuzz has similarities to the oni and Magmar has similarities to the Karura.\nElectabuzz is the only member of its family not to have some physical relation to an AC power unit. Elekid's head is shaped like a power plug while Electivire's back pattern looks like a power socket.\nDesign variations\nIn its Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue artwork, Electabuzz has four fingers; however, it is typically depicted with five fingers in its sprites and artwork, as well as in the animated series. In Pok\u00e9mon Stadium and Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2, it is depicted with six fingers.\n\n\n\n\n\nRed and Green art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed and Blue art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuby and Sapphire series art\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStadium model\n\n\n\n\nOrigin\nElectabuzz seems to be based on the Japanese oni, a horned ogre that wears tiger skin as clothing and sometimes have powers of thunder and lightning. Most notably Raijin, who is often depicted as an oni, is a god of lightning. Its tail resembles that of a tiger.
