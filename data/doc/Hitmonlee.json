Lacking a distinct neck and head, its upper torso has almond-shaped eyes with black space around them and appears to lack a nose and mouth. Primarily brown, it has cream-colored, segmented arms and legs. Each hand has three fingers and each foot has three clawed toes. The soles of its feet and its ankles have circular, yellow pads. Hitmonlee is an exclusively male species with no female counterpart.\nHitmonlee's legs freely contract and stretch similar to a coiled spring (and one particular Hitmonlee can do this with its arms as well). The source of its power comes from the ligaments in its legs that Hitmonlee can fully control. This flexibility allows Hitmonlee to run with lengthy strides, giving it greater reach for its kicks. Its excellent sense of balance enables it to kick in succession from any position. Hitmonlee's kicking strength is incredibly powerful owing to its diamond-like soles. Right before kicking an opponent, Hitmonlee will harden the muscles on the sole of its foot, allowing it to maximize the full power of its kick. It has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Kick Master\". After battling, it rubs down its legs to relax the tight muscles. Rarely found in the wild, it is primarily found in urban areas. It has been seen competing with either Hitmonchan, or Hitmontop.\nHitmonlee has had several kicking moves as signature moves:\n\nHigh Jump Kick (Prior to Generation III)\nJump Kick (Prior to Generation IV)\nRolling Kick (Prior to Generation VII)\nMega Kick (In Generation II, and from Generation IV to VI)\nPrior to Generation V, Reckless was Hitmonlee's signature Ability.\n\nEvolution\nHitmonlee evolves from Tyrogue.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nTyrogue\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nHitmonlee\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness: Hitmonlee, together with Bronzong and Regigigas, are the statues that came alive to battle the player in Aegis Cave.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #106\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nWhen in a hurry, its legs lengthen progressively.

It can often be seen rubbing its legs down after a battle. In the original Super Smash Bros., it would shout to get itself pumped up and then launch fighters directly upward with a powerful kick. \n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nHitmonlee appears as a Spirit.\n\nTrivia\nHitmonlee and Hitmonchan are the only Pok\u00e9mon that were introduced as not being related to each other in an evolutionary line but later became part of the same evolutionary line as each other.\nAccording to Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver: Prima's Official Strategy Guide, Hitmonlee is the only Pok\u00e9mon recommended for the Disc Catch that is not a Flying-type.\nHitmonlee and Hitmonchan received the biggest increase to their Special stat in Generation II, gaining 75 points of Special Defense.\nHitmonlee has more former signature moves than any other Pok\u00e9mon, with a total of four.\nHitmonlee's English name was suggested by Bill Giese, who assisted in the naming of many Generation I Pok\u00e9mon.[1]\nOrigin\nBased on its Japanese name and kicking attribute, Hitmonlee may represent Japanese kickboxer Tadashi Sawamura. Hitmonlee may be a personification of martial arts that focus on kicking, such as kickboxing, savate, Muay Thai, and Taekwondo. Due to its lack of a head, Hitmonlee's design bears a resemblance to mythical headless men such as the Xingtian and the Hindu demon Kabandha. Hitmonlee's legs are stretchy and can act like a spring which reminds of cartoonish concept of punching glove on a spring.\n\nName origin\nHitmonlee is named after Bruce Lee[1] and may additionally involve a combination of hit and monster. The name is also related to Hitmonchan and Hitmontop, both of which are parallel evolutions to it as of Generation II.\nSawamular may be derived from Tadashi Sawamura, a famous kickboxer.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b5\u30ef\u30e0\u30e9\u30fc Sawamular\n\nFrom Japanese kickboxer \u6ca2\u6751\u5fe0 Tadashi Sawamura\n\n\n French\n\nKicklee\n\nFrom kick and Bruce Lee\n\n\n Spanish\n\nHitmonlee\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nKicklee\n\nFrom Kick and Bruce Lee\n\n\n Italian\n\nHitmonlee\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc2dc\ub77c\uc18c\ubaac Sirasomon\n\nFrom \uc2dc\ub77c\uc18c\ub2c8 Sirasoni (nickname of famed Korean street knight \uc774\uc131\uc21c Yi Sung-sun) and monster\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u98db\u817f\u90ce / \u98de\u817f\u90ce F\u0113itu\u01d0l\u00e1ng*\u6c99\u74e6\u90ce Sh\u0101w\u01cel\u00e1ng*\n\nFrom \u98db\u817f / \u98de\u817f f\u0113itu\u01d0 and \u90ce l\u00e1ngFrom the partial transcription of its Japanese name and \u90ce l\u00e1ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u98db\u817f\u90ce F\u0113it\u00e9uil\u00f2hng*\u6c99\u53e4\u62c9 S\u0101g\u00fal\u0101ai*\n\nFrom \u98db\u817f f\u0113it\u00e9ui and \u90ce l\u00f2hngPartial transcription of its Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0915\u093f\u0915\u093e\u091f\u0948\u0915 Kickattack\n\nFrom kick and attack\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0425\u0438\u0442\u043c\u043e\u043d\u043b\u0438 Khitmonli\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e0b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e39\u0e25\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c Sawamula\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nGiovanni's Hitmonlee\nHitmons\nReferences\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Dockery, Daniel (October 4, 2022).
