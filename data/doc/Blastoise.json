It is the final form of Squirtle.\nBlastoise has two forms: Mega Blastoise and Gigantamax Blastoise. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Blastoise using the Blastoisinite, and can Gigantamax into Gigantamax Blastoise if it has the Gigantamax Factor. Gigantamax Blastoise was introduced in The Isle of Armor.\nBlastoise is the game mascot of the Japanese and international versions of Pok\u00e9mon Blue, appearing on the boxart of both games.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biology\n\n1.1 Forms\n1.2 Evolution\n\n\n2 Game data\n\n2.1 NPC appearances\n2.2 Pok\u00e9dex entries\n\n2.2.1 Alternate games\n\n\n2.3 Game locations\n\n2.3.1 In side games\n2.3.2 In events\n\n2.3.2.1 Wild Area News\n2.3.2.2 Pok\u00e9 Portal News\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Held items\n2.5 Stats\n\n2.5.1 Base stats\n\n2.5.1.1 Blastoise\n2.5.1.2 Mega Blastoise\n\n\n2.5.2 Pok\u00e9athlon stats\n\n\n2.6 Type effectiveness\n2.7 Learnset\n\n2.7.1 By leveling up\n2.7.2 By TM\n2.7.3 By breeding\n2.7.4 By a prior Evolution\n\n\n2.8 Side game data\n\n2.8.1 Blastoise\n2.8.2 Mega Blastoise\n\n\n2.9 Form data\n\n2.9.1 Mega Evolution\n2.9.2 Gigantamax\n\n\n2.10 Evolution data\n2.11 Sprites\n\n2.11.1 Other sprites\n\n\n\n\n3 In animation\n\n3.1 Main series\n\n3.1.1 Major appearances\n\n3.1.1.1 Gary's Blastoise\n3.1.1.2 Tierno's Blastoise\n3.1.1.3 Other\n\n\n3.1.2 Minor appearances\n3.1.3 Pok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n3.2 Pok\u00e9mon Origins\n3.3 Pok\u00e9mon Generations\n3.4 GOTCHA!\n3.5 Pok\u00e9mon Evolutions\n\n\n4 In the manga\n\n4.1 Pok\u00e9mon Adventures\n\n4.1.1 Major appearances\n\n4.1.1.1 Blasty\n\n\n4.1.2 Minor appearances\n\n\n4.2 Pok\u00e9mon Pocket Monsters\n4.3 Pok\u00e9mon Ruby-Sapphire\n4.4 Pocket Monsters HGSS\n4.5 Magical Pok\u00e9mon Journey\n4.6 Pok\u00e9mon Zensho\n4.7 Movie adaptations\n4.8 Pok\u00e9mon: Yeah!

Its body is blue and is mostly hidden by its tough, brown shell. This shell has a cream-colored underside and a white ridge encircling its arms and separating the upper and lower halves. Two powerful water cannons/jet nozzles reside at the top of its shell over its shoulders. These cannons can be extended or withdrawn. Blastoise's head has triangular ears that are black on the inside, small brown eyes, and a cream-colored lower jaw. Its arms are thick, and it has three claws on each hand. Its feet have three claws on the front and one on the back. Poking out of the bottom of its shell is a stubby tail.\nThe powerful cannons on this Pok\u00e9mon's back can produce water blasts that can pierce steel and concrete and be used for high-speed charges. The speed of Blastoise's charges is similar to the force of a rocket. Blastoise makes itself heavy to withstand these powerful blasts and crush its opponents. It is shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise that Blastoise can take the role of a leader in large groups of Squirtle and Wartortle. Its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Blastoise is known to sleep soundly while protected by its tough shell.[1] Blastoise has also been seen sleeping with its belly exposed on very rare occasions. This is due to Blastoise feeling completely secure in its surroundings and quickly falling asleep.\nIn Generation II, Blastoise and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding.\n\n\nForms\n Gigantamax Blastoise shooting streams of water from its cannons\nBlastoise has two forms: Mega Blastoise and Gigantamax Blastoise.\nWhen Mega Evolved, Blastoise develops two smaller shells over its arms, each with its water cannon. The two cannons on its back are replaced by a single, central water cannon of greater size that can retract into its shell. This cannon extends forward over Mega Blastoise's head and is said to have a blast range of over 6 miles (10 kilometers).[2] Small ridges develop over its now-red eyes and extend to its ears \u2014 which angle slightly backward \u2014 and there is a small point on its chin.\nAs Gigantamax Blastoise, it becomes larger. Its eyes are white with bright blue sclerae. Its blue arms, head, and legs change to light blue, and the underside of its shell becomes dark red. Its shell transforms into a battleship-like formation, with 31 cannons of different sizes: sets of twin cannons emerge from hexagon and rectangle-shaped holes within the shell, and a main cannon protrudes from the center. Several white triangular spots are located on its tail and legs. Three red clouds surround the main cannon.\nGigantamax Blastoise can adapt to any situation using various cannon combinations. It is not very good at precision shooting, so instead of aiming its attacks, it prefers to overwhelm its opponent by launching dynamic, powerful torrents from its cannons. According to one legend, its main cannon is so staggeringly powerful it can blast holes through the mountains. Gigantamax Blastoise can also individually align the 12 cannons surrounding its main cannon to attack in any direction.[3]\nGigantamax Blastoise is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Cannonade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMegaBlastoise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGigantamaxBlastoise\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nBlastoise evolves from Wartortle and is the final form of Squirtle.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nSquirtle\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\nLevel 16\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nWartortle\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\nLevel 36\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nBlastoise\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Blastoise is the leader of Team Hydro, a Bronze Rank rescue team. It joins a new team designed to rescue Team A.C.T. from Magma Cavern but fails to reach them. Blastoise appears to go exploring a lot as it discovers Western Cave and Meteor Cave. It reaches the end of Western Cave with Charizard of Team A.C.T., but both are defeated by Mewtwo. Blastoise is quick to anger, a feature that Charizard exploits to boost morale.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #009\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nA brutal Pok\u00e9mon with pressurized water jets on its shell.

Melee\nBlastoise reappears as a Pok\u00e9 Ball Pok\u00e9mon in Super Smash Bros. Melee. Like in SSB, it uses Hydro Pump as its attack. Blastoise's trophy also refers to Blastoise as the 'Definitive Water Type'.\n\nTrophy information\n\"Blastoise is the next evolutionary step after Wartortle. The thick jets of water they shoot from the cannons on their backs are strong enough to cut through steel plating. When in danger, they hide inside their armored shells. Blastoise is so popular among Trainers that it's considered the definitive Water-type.\"\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Brawl\nBlastoise was briefly considered as a possible playable character before it was switched out for Squirtle.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U\nBlastoise appears in the background of the Flood Chamber in the Kalos Pok\u00e9mon League, along with Wailord, Piplup, and Clawitzer.\n\n Mega Blastoise trophy in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS\nA trophy of Mega Blastoise also exists in both versions of the game.\n\nTrophy information\nBlastoise\nNA: On a hot summer day, it's great to cool off by playing in a sprinkler. Don't look to Blastoise as a replacement, though\u2014those water jets on its back are extremely powerful and would send you flying. In fact, Blastoise itself is so huge so it doesn't get blown away when it fires. Speaking of fires, Blastoise is better than a fire truck at putting them out!\nPAL: Tempted to have a Blastoise hose the mud off your bike? Well, don't. The water jets from its rocket cannons might look perfect for that, but they'd just blast your bike into oblivion. In fact, the reason Blastoise grow so big and heavy is so they don't get blown away themselves. If your house is on fire, though, feel free to get a Blastoise to help!\n\nMega Blastoise\nNA: Some species of Pok\u00e9mon living in Kalos have the ability to Mega Evolve, and here's one! Mega Blastoise is a bit bigger than Blastoise, and instead of two cannons on its shell, it has one huge cannon. This may seem like a downgrade, but wait\u2013there are two on its arms! This math is easy: three is better than two.\nPAL: Some species of Pok\u00e9mon living in Kalos have the ability to Mega Evolve, and here's one! Mega Blastoise is a bit bigger than Blastoise, and instead of two cannons on its shell, it has one huge cannon. This may seem like a downgrade, but wait - there are two on its arms, too! Basic arithmetic: three is better than two.\n\n Blastoise in Pokk\u00e9n Tournament\nPokk\u00e9n Tournament DX\nMain article: Blastoise (Pokk\u00e9n)\nBlastoise is a Battle Pok\u00e9mon in the Nintendo Switch version of Pokk\u00e9n Tournament.

Upon entering Synergy Burst, it Mega Evolves and can use the Burst Attack Destructive Cannon.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nBlastoise retains its role as a background character in the Kalos Pok\u00e9mon League's Flood Chamber. It also appears as a Spirit.\n\nPOK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu\nA Blastoise appeared in POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu. It battled a Gengar at an illegal fight club, only to be defeated.\n\nPok\u00e9mon UNITE\nMain article: Blastoise (UNITE)\nBlastoise is playable through obtaining a Unite License. It is a ranged defender that starts as Squirtle and evolves into Wartortle at level 5, which evolves into Blastoise at level 9.\n\n\nTrivia\nBlastoise shares its category with Kabuto and Kabutops. They are all known as the Shellfish Pok\u00e9mon.\nEarly concept art for a Pok\u00e9mon called \"Karabajio\" resembles Blastoise without its signature water cannons. The name may be a combination of \"carapace\" and Caravaggio.\nMega Blastoise is the only Mega-Evolved first partner Pok\u00e9mon that does not have two types.\nThe way Blastoise flies in New Pok\u00e9mon Snap is a potential reference to Gamera.[4]\nBlastoise was originally considered for Super Smash Bros. Brawl alongside Charizard and Ivysaur, but director Masahiro Sakurai decided to go with Squirtle instead for evolutionary stage balance.[5]\nOrigin\nBlastoise's design appears to be a turtle mixed with aspects of a tank. Blastoise's cannons may have been derived from the functioning tubes found in mussels and some other shellfish, thus its category.\nGigantamax Blastoise's shell may be based on a battleship.
