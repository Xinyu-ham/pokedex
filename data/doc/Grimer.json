It has two large eyes with beady pupils and a gaping mouth with a gray tongue. While it lacks any visible legs, it does have two arms with three digits on each hand. Its purple sludge body contains a variety of pungent bacteria, which are so potent that it renders soil barren and incapable of supporting plant life. It is constantly oozing a bacteria-rich fluid from all parts of its body. Should it run out of internal germs, Grimer will die. Pieces of it often break off during travel and go on to become new Grimer. When combined with another Grimer, it produces new poisonous compounds.\nDue to its lack of a solid form, Grimer is capable of squeezing into any space or crevices with relative ease. It uses this to penetrate sewage pipes and feed off of the filthy wastewater inside. Its population fluctuates based on the availability of waste, which is Grimer's main diet. It can be found in polluted lakes and streams, as well as within cities and factories where trash and industrial waste can be found. In recent years, thanks to efforts in environmental improvements and a decrease in their food source of waste, Grimer is now facing extinction.\nPrior to Generation IV, Grimer and its evolved form, Muk, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Stench as an Ability.\n\nForms\nGrimer has a regional form: Alolan Grimer.\nGrimer was brought to Alola to deal with the excess waste generated by the region's increased population. Alolan Grimer eats solid garbage instead of sludge; this new diet has caused its body composition and form to change. Alolan Grimer's body is green with a line of yellow sludge along its lower lip that extends around behind its head, a bright blue tongue, and small black crescent-shaped spaces behind its eyes. It also has two blunt \"teeth\" in its upper jaw, which are actually crystallized toxins formed by its diet. It is not known how to break down these toxic crystals, but direct contact with them is known to be dangerous. Lethal poisons leak out of Alolan Grimer's body when these crystals fall out. Because it produces and stores toxins within its body, Alolan Grimer does not produce a foul stench like Kantonian Grimer.[1][2]\nThere are usually about one hundred Alolan Grimer found living near waste-disposal sites in Alola, assisting people in dealing with garbage. Alolan Grimer is widely used and a very popular Pok\u00e9mon used in garbage disposal facilities around the world. Alolan Grimer is perpetually hungry and must constantly eat trash. If no trash is readily available, it will eat other manufactured products instead.[3]\nIn addition to garbage, Alolan Grimer preys on Trubbish and Garbodor; its introduction to Alola caused their populations to decrease in the region. They can also be found in the Coastal Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated.\nAlolan Grimer and its evolved form, Alolan Muk, are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Power of Alchemy as an Ability.\n\nEvolution\nGrimer evolves into Muk.\nAlolan Grimer evolves into Alolan Muk.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nGrimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nGrimer\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nMuk\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlolan Grimer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nGrimerAlolan Form\u00a0Poison\u00a0\u00a0Dark\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nMukAlolan Form\u00a0Poison\u00a0\u00a0Dark\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #088\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nAppears in filthy areas.

He used it extensively to smother Blue, preventing him from breathing and restrict his movement so that he would be unable to call on his Pok\u00e9mon. He used it again during the battle against Agatha, but to little effect.\nIn A Flaaffy Kerfuffle, a Grimer was in Professor Oak's fantasy when he explained that Trainers should only have six Pok\u00e9mon with them.\nJanine owns a Grimer in Notorious Noctowl.

It reappeared in A Challenge to the Elite Four!.\nA Grimer appeared in Clefairy Evolves... At Last?!.\n\nIn the TCG\nMain article: Grimer (TCG)\nTrivia\nIn Sparks Fly for Magnemite, Grimer's animated series debut, Grimer had a very strong odor that made most people around the Grimer cover their noses from the smell. However, in later episodes, Grimer's smell has seemingly ceased to exist. This is most obvious in Camping It Up!, where Dawn is given a Grimer to train, and it immediately hugs her, but no one complains about any smell.\nGrimer shares similar traits to Koffing and Trubbish. All three Pok\u00e9mon are pure Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon with a single evolved form, roughly the same base stat totals and evolution levels, and appear to be based on a different kind of pollution; Grimer being water pollution.\nAlolan Grimer and its Alolan evolution were designed by Hitoshi Ariga.[4]\nAlolan Grimer had no Egg Moves in Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet prior to Version 2.0.1. This was presumably unintentional, as it regained them in said version. The same situation occurred with Luvdisc and Cacnea.\nOrigin\nGrimer appears to be a pile of living sludge, and may be based upon the general concept of living slime in popular culture. It may also be based on the imagined fear that heavy pollution, caused by the leakage and/or improper disposal of toxic/radioactive waste, may result in the creation of new and undesirable life. It may also be based on Dorotab\u014d, a one-eyed, three-fingered y\u014dkai that rises from the mud of neglected, overgrown rice fields.\nAlolan Grimer may be based on an oil slick, particularly the rainbow colors that are produced when a thin layer of oil floats on top of water; this is due to a phenomenon called thin-film interference. In the real world, oil spills are a major threat to ecosystems in the world's oceans and particularly in Hawaii, which Alola is based on. Its reduced size may reference insular dwarfism or, since its Alolan Form was brought about by human influence, dwarfing.\n\nName origin\nGrimer may be derived from grime (dirt or filth).\nBetbeter may be derived from \u3079\u3068\u3079\u3068 betobeto and \u3079\u305f\u3079\u305f betabeta, both meaning sticky.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30d9\u30c8\u30d9\u30bf\u30fc Betbeter\n\nFrom \u3079\u3068\u3079\u3068 betobeto and \u3079\u305f\u3079\u305f betabeta\n\n\n French\n\nTadmorv\n\nFrom tas de morve\n\n\n Spanish\n\nGrimer\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nSleima\n\nFrom Schleim and Matsch\n\n\n Italian\n\nGrimer\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc9c8\ud37d\uc774 Jilpeogi\n\nFrom \uc9c8\ud37d\ud558\ub2e4 jilpeoghada\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u81ed\u6ce5 Ch\u00f2un\u00ed\n\nFrom \u81ed ch\u00f2u and \u6ce5 n\u00ed\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u81ed\u6ce5 Chaun\u00e0ih*\u721b\u6ce5\u602a Laahnn\u00e0ihgwaai*\n\nFrom \u81ed chau and \u6ce5 n\u00e0ihFrom \u721b\u6ce5 laahnn\u00e0ih and \u602a gwaai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0907\u092e\u0930 Grimer\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0435\u0440 Graimer\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e42\u0e15\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e15\u0e32 Betobeta\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nGoh's Grimer\nArtificial Pok\u00e9mon\nRegional form\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Muk\n\n\u2191 Samson Oak: \"Did you know that Alolan Grimer are in fact not native to the region at all, but instead are what we would call naturalized Pok\u00e9mon? There is not so much sludge and pollution for Grimer to feed on here in Alola, though, so they have grown to feed on garbage instead. They do not give off a foul stench, thanks to the way they contain any poisons within their bodies, but their crystals are terribly poisonous!\"\n\n\u2191 Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Grimer\n\n\u2191 Tweet by \u3042\u308a\u304c\u3072\u3068\u3057/ArigaHitoshi (@ariga_megamix).
