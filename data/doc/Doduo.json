Each head has a long sharp beak and two beady black eyes. It has a bristly, down-like covering of brown feathers on its body and both heads. A male has black flexible necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs. Each foot has four digits ending in a sharp claw. Both heads have an identical brain. However, it is believed that on occasion they may possess different brains. It is also theorized that the two heads communicate with some form of telepathy for coordination. Even when sleeping or nourishing itself with food and water, one head is usually awake and alert and keeps a keen eye out for enemies. The two heads switch turns every hour or so, with both only sleeping at the same time when they feel completely safe. Both heads have the same genes and battle together in perfect sync.\nDue to its almost non-existent wings, it cannot fly very well. However, it has developed legs that make it a powerful runner. Reaching speeds of 60 mph (100 km/h), it energetically strides across the plains leaving large 4-inch (10-centimeter) deep footprints behind it. It can better maintain balance while running by raising and lowering its two heads. Doduo lives in wide open plains, grasslands, and savannahs.\n\nEvolution\nDoduo evolves into Dodrio.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nDoduo\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nDodrio\u00a0Normal\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #084\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nA bird that makes up for its poor flying with its fast foot speed.

However, Dodrio's base Speed stat is higher.\nDoduo and Dodrio are the only Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon consisting of a head and legs.\nOrigin\nDespite its name, Doduo seems like it has more in common with ostriches than dodos. It also seems to show some similarities to the moa, an extinct flightless bird indigenous to New Zealand; and the emu, another flightless bird. It also resembles the kiwi in some ways as well. According to Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, Doduo was discovered 3 years prior to the original games and is believed that its double head is a recent mutation.\n\nName origin\nDoduo may be a combination of dodo (an extinct, flightless bird) and duo (a pair).\nDodo is literally dodo.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30c9\u30fc\u30c9\u30fc Dodo\n\nFrom dodo\n\n\n French\n\nDoduo\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Spanish\n\nDoduo\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nDodu\n\nFrom Dodo and Duo\n\n\n Italian\n\nDoduo\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub450\ub450 Dudu\n\nFrom dodo and \ub450 du\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u561f\u561f D\u016bd\u016b\n\nFrom \u561f\u561f\u9ce5 / \u561f\u561f\u9e1f d\u016bd\u016b-ni\u01ceo\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u561f\u561f D\u014dud\u014du*\u591a\u591a D\u014dd\u014d*\n\nFrom \u561f\u561f\u96c0 d\u014dud\u014du-j\u00e9ukFrom the transcription of Japanese name and \u591a\u591a d\u014dd\u014d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0921\u094b\u0921\u0941\u0913 Doduo\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0414\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043e Doduo\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e42\u0e14\u0e42\u0e14 Dodo\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nDody\nDodrio (UNITE)\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0083: Farfetch'd\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0085: Dodrio\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Doduo_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4129106\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monNormal-type Pok\u00e9monFlying-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupBrown-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 07 Pok\u00e9monFlying group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hoenn Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 310Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became both Special Attack and Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 18 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monF.E.A.R.-compatible Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 22:27.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
