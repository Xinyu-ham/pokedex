Its length makes it the tallest Rock-type Pok\u00e9mon. It has black eyes and a rounded snout. On top of its head is a rocky spine. As it grows older, it becomes more rounded and smoother, eventually becoming similar to black diamonds. Inside its brain is a magnet that serves as an internal compass, guiding Onix wherever they need to go and prevents them from getting lost while digging.\nOnix tunnels under the ground at over 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour, which causes tremors and a terrifying roar that echoes a long way. Hard objects encountered while tunneling are absorbed into its body, which makes it very sturdy. It also consumes the boulders for food. The massive, winding tunnels it leaves behind are used as homes by Diglett. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon Stadium series, Onix is capable of rotating its head, or any part of its body, in a full 360 degrees. It is a very aggressive Pok\u00e9mon that will constantly attack humans and other Pok\u00e9mon when in pain, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode To Master the Onixpected!. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga, Onix can be separated from its body segments in battle and be fine later on, either regenerating or reattaching to its body segments.[1] It is said that an Onix that lives for about 100 years will evolve into a Steelix after its composition becomes more diamond-like. It can be found in mountains and caves. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Onix is known on occasion to sleep while in the middle of digging through tunnels.[2]Onix is believed to be a deep sleeper due to the protection offered by its sturdy body.\n\nEvolution\nOnix evolves into Steelix.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nOnix\u00a0Rock\u00a0\u00a0Ground\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nSteelix\u00a0Steel\u00a0\u00a0Ground\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #095\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nAs it grows, the stone portions of its body harden to become similar to a diamond, but colored black.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nBurrows at high speed in search of food.

Its great size could have been inspired by the Mongolian death worm, an earthworm-like creature noted for its colossal length (compared to regular worms) of up to 7 feet. The Onix lifestyle, living underground and ingesting massive amounts of soil while tunneling, is much closer to the earthworm lifestyle than the snake lifestyle. Earthworms eat soil and digest the organic material it contains (plant matter, living protozoa, rotifers, nematodes, bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms).\n\nName origin\nOnix may be derived from onyx (a mineral).\nIwark may be a combination of \u5ca9 iwa (rock) and either \u30d6\u30eb\u30ef\u30fc\u30af bulwark or \u30b9\u30cd\u30fc\u30af snake.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30a4\u30ef\u30fc\u30af Iwark\n\nFrom \u5ca9 iwa and snake\n\n\n French\n\nOnix\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Spanish\n\nOnix\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nOnix\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Italian\n\nOnix\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub871\uc2a4\ud1a4 Rongston\n\nFrom long and stone\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5927\u5ca9\u86c7 D\u00e0y\u00e1nsh\u00e9\n\nFrom \u5927 d\u00e0, \u5ca9 y\u00e1n, and \u86c7 sh\u00e9\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5927\u5ca9\u86c7 Daaihng\u00e0ahms\u00e8h\n\nFrom \u5927 daaih, \u5ca9 ng\u00e0ahm, and \u86c7 s\u00e8h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d0\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 Oniks\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0911\u0928\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 Onix\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441 Oniks\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e27\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e04 Iwak\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nBrock's Onix\nBruno's Onix\nCrystal Onix\nJasmine's Onix\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Seen in the chapters PS005, PS033, and PS041.\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Smash Bros. series\n\n\nGames:\n\nSuper Smash Bros. \u2022 Super Smash Bros.
