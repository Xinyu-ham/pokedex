Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs. The upper pair of its legs resemble small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resembles long, digit-less feet. Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation. Two oval scales on a female Butterfree's lower wings are black, but they are white on a male.\nThe wings of Butterfree are coated with poisonous scales that easily fall off continuously as it flies. If inhaled, it results in several status conditions. Using this powder, it will defend Caterpie from bird Pok\u00e9mon. This powder also repels water, enabling it to fly and gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree can use its sensitive antenna to detect the odors of blooming flowers six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of nectar, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes, it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode A Sappy Ending. Butterfree is found in temperate forests and jungles, but it also observed in the episode Bye Bye Butterfree flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Butterfree is known to sleep while flapping its wings. It tends to accidentally scatter highly toxic dust while sleeping.[1]\n\nForms\nButterfree has a Gigantamax Form.\nAs Gigantamax Butterfree, its wings become shades of bright and dark green with a white pattern. A fur-like circle attaches to Gigantamax Butterfree's back at the base of the wings. Its antennae also become bright green and extend to the point where the tip bends, and three red clouds surround them. Its eyes glow bright red. Several green scales, created from crystallized Gigantamax energy, can be seen floating around Gigantamax Butterfree. These are its most effective weapons, capable of causing paralysis, poisoning, or sleep. Gigantamax Butterfree scatters these scales by the winds that it generates with each flap of its wings; these winds are powerful enough to lift a 10-ton truck.[2]\nGigantamax Butterfree is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the G-Max Move G-Max Befuddle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGigantamax Butterfree\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nButterfree evolves from Metapod and is the final form of Caterpie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nCaterpie\u00a0Bug\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nMetapod\u00a0Bug\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nButterfree\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team: Butterfree is the mother of Caterpie, who she sends the player to rescue in the first mission of the game.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #012\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nIn battle, it flaps its wings at high speed to release highly toxic dust into the air.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nIts wings, covered with poisonous powders, repel water.

Ultimate\nButterfree returns in the Saffron City stage.\n\nTrivia\nButterfree was the first Pok\u00e9mon shown in Pok\u00e9mon the Series with an alternate color, pink in its case. This has only been seen in a single female, and unlike a Shiny Butterfree, which has green eyes and pink wings, limbs, and snout, this Butterfree only differed in its pink body and wings.\nButterfree shares its category with Beautifly. They are both known as the Butterfly Pok\u00e9mon.\nButterfree can be seen as a parallel to Beedrill. Both of their unevolved stages evolve at level 7 and again at level 10. They both go through metamorphosis-like evolution and have the same base stat total of 395. Also, while Beedrill is exclusive to Black and Black 2, Butterfree is exclusive to White and White 2. Both also have an alternate form only available in-battle (Gigantamax Butterfree and Mega Beedrill, respectively).\nOrigin\nButterfree seems to be based on the black-veined white butterfly.\nButterfree's parallels to Beedrill could possibly be a reference to the phrase \"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee\", which was coined by American boxer Muhammad Ali. This is further backed by the phrase being used in two episodes[3] of the English dub of the Pok\u00e9mon animated series as \"floating like a Butterfree and stinging like a Beedrill\".\n\nName origin\nButterfree may be a combination of butterfly and free. It may also involve \u30d1\u30bf\u30d1\u30bf patapata (the sound of wings flapping) and \u632f\u308b furu (to flap).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30d0\u30bf\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc Butterfree\n\nFrom butterfly, free, \u30d1\u30bf\u30d1\u30bf patapata, and \u632f\u308b furu\n\n\n French\n\nPapilusion\n\nFrom papillon and illusion\n\n\n Spanish\n\nButterfree\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n German\n\nSmettbo\n\nFrom Schmetterling and possibly B\u00f6\n\n\n Italian\n\nButterfree\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ubc84\ud130\ud50c Butterfle\n\nFrom butterfly\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5df4\u5927\u8776 B\u0101d\u00e0di\u00e9\u5df4\u5927\u8774 B\u0101d\u00e0h\u00fa *\n\nFrom the partial transcription of its Japanese name and \u8774\u8776 h\u00fadi\u00e9\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5df4\u5927\u8776 B\u0101daaihdihp*\u5df4\u4ed6\u8776 B\u0101t\u0101dihp*\n\nFrom the partial transcription of its Japanese name and \u8774\u8776 w\u00f9hd\u00edp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Bulgarian\n\n\u0411\u0430\u0442\u044a\u0440\u0444\u0440\u0438 Bat\u016drfri\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d1\u05d8\u05e8\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9 Butterfree\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092c\u091f\u0930\u092b\u093c\u094d\u0930\u0940 Batterfri\n\nTranscription of English/Japanese name\n\n\n Hungarian\n\nCsodalepke*\n\nFrom csoda and lepke\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nDrugelaisvis\n\nFrom drugys and laisvas\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0411\u0430\u0442\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0444\u0440\u0438 Batterfri\n\nTranscription of English/Japanese name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e15\u0e40\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e1f\u0e23\u0e35 Battoefri\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nAsh's Butterfree\nPink Butterfree\nGoh's Butterfree\nKitty\nGigantamax\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 Gigantamax Butterfree | Official Website | Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield\n\n\u2191 Disaster of Disguise and Strong Strategy Steals the Show!\n\n\nExternal links\n\n Gigantamax forms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0011: Metapod\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0013: Weedle\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Butterfree_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4148168\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monBug-type Pok\u00e9monFlying-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupWhite-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 13 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with different formsBug group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 385Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became both Special Attack and Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 395Pok\u00e9mon with 18 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monShadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XDPok\u00e9mon whose base stats changed in Generation VI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 18 October 2024, at 00:39.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
