Its head and thorax are both light purple, and it has bulbous, round, light blue eyes, a small mandible, and a three-point crest on its head. Tucked close to its thorax are three pairs of tiny, whitish legs. Its abdomen is paler with several black, zigzagging stripes encircling it. It has two pairs of pale purple moth-like wings with thin black venation. Its official artwork and various TCG cards depict the wings as translucent.[1]\nVenomoth's wings are covered in dust-like scales that vary in color depending on their toxic capability. Dark scales are poisonous, while lighter scales can cause paralysis. These scales are released when Venomoth flutters its wings and leak out poison once they make contact with the skin. Venomoth lives in dense temperate forests with thick undergrowth and little light. As a nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon, Venomoth comes out at night to hunt for its favorite prey. It prefers to feed on insects that gather around light sources, and Venomoth is attracted to bright lights itself. As stated in the third chapter of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, Venomoth has a short lifespan.\n\n\nEvolution\nVenomoth evolves from Venonat.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nVenonat\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nVenomoth\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #049\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nThe dust-like scales covering its wings are color coded to indicate the kinds of poison it has.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nThe powdery scales on its wings are hard to remove.

They are both known as the Poison Moth Pok\u00e9mon.\nIn early official art, Venomoth had yellow spots on the back of its wings. This was removed when later official artwork was released.\nIn Ruby and Sapphire, Venomoth's sprite color set contains 2 shades of yellow that go unused.\nVenomoth's Crystal sprite is different from its Gold and Silver sprite, making it one of the few Pok\u00e9mon to have three different sprites in Generation II.\nVenomoth and its pre-evolved form are the Pok\u00e9mon that went the longest without appearing in a regional Pok\u00e9dex, excluding their appearances in remakes: prior to the release of Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet, their last appearance in a regional Pok\u00e9dex was in Crystal, almost 22 years earlier.\nOrigin\nVenomoth seems to be based on swallowtail moths, many of which are toxic. Its face and insect diet suggest that it may also draw inspiration from lacewings, which, like many moths, are attracted to lights at night. Specifically, it may be a play on moth lacewing (family Ithonidae).\nIts Shiny coloration is similar to a blue morpho butterfly.\n\nName origin\nVenomoth may be a combination of venom and moth.\nMorphon may be derived from metamorphosis or the butterfly genus Morpho.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30e2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3 Morphon\n\nFrom metamorphosis or the genus Morpho\n\n\n French\n\nA\u00e9romite\n\nFrom a\u00e9ro- and mite\n\n\n Spanish\n\nVenomoth\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nOmot\n\nFrom venom and Motte\n\n\n Italian\n\nVenomoth\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub3c4\ub098\ub9ac Donari\n\nFrom \ub3c5 (\u6bd2) dok, \ub0a0\ub2e4 nalda, and \uff5e\uc774 -i\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u6469\u9b6f\u86fe / \u6469\u9c81\u86fe M\u00f3l\u01d4'\u00e9*\u672b\u5165\u86fe M\u00f2r\u00f9'\u00e9*\n\nFrom the partial transcription of Japanese name and \u86fe \u00e9From the partial transcription of Japanese name, \u7c89\u672b f\u011bnm\u00f2, and \u86fe \u00e9\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u6469\u9b6f\u86fe M\u014dl\u00f3uh'ng\u00f2h*\u9b54\u9b6f\u98a8 M\u014dl\u00f3uhf\u016bng*\n\nFrom the partial transcription of Japanese name and \u86fe ng\u00f2hFrom the transcription of Japanese name and \u98a8 f\u016bng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0935\u0947\u0928\u094b\u092e\u0949\u0925 Venomoth\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nVenomotas\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0412\u0435\u043d\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0442 Venomot\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e1f\u0e2d\u0e19 Mofon\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\u2191 Depicted on the Venomoth cards Unbroken Bonds 12, Silver Tempest 2, and 151 49.\n\n\nRelated articles\nTracey's Venomoth\nGoh's Venomoth\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0048: Venonat\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0050: Diglett\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Venomoth_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128487\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monBug-type Pok\u00e9monPoison-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupPurple-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 13 Pok\u00e9monBug group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 450Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with 18 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monShadow Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon XD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 16:22.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
