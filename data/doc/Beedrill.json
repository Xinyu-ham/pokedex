Beedrill's head is round with a slightly pointed mouth, large, red eyes, and black antennae with a sharp bend in the middle. Its forelegs are tipped with long, conical stingers. It stands on its other two legs, which are long, segmented, and insectoid in shape. Beedrill has two pairs of rounded, veined wings and another stinger on its yellow-and-black striped abdomen. The abdominal stinger contains Beedrill's most potent poison.\nBeedrill is highly territorial and unlike real wasp and bees, Beedrill are not confirmed to live in true \"hives\", as they work together to solve basic problems regarding food, territory, and reproduction without any confirmation if there is a singular breeding pair or \"Queen.\" As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Challenge of the Samurai, Beedrill seems to be especially concerned with the welfare of Weedle and Kakuna, responding aggressively to those that disturb them. Disturbing one Beedrill will cause the whole group to attack. It flies at high speed and attacks using the large venomous stingers on its forelegs and abdomen. It will then take the victims of its attacks back to its nest for food. Beedrill nests in temperate forests and misty wooded areas. It is known to collect pollen, which Teddiursa combines with fruits to concoct honey. In the twelfth chapter of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures, Beedrill is shown living in groups or packs and producing honey. Prior to Generation V, Twineedle was its signature move.\n\nForms\nBeedrill can Mega Evolve into Mega Beedrill.\nAs Mega Beedrill, it gains more defined features. The antennae are shorter and T-shaped. Its eyes become longer and sleeker. It now has three pairs of wings; the uppermost pair is larger with black trim along the top. Its stingers become longer and larger, resembling lances. Additional conical, black-and-yellow stingers with white tips take the place of its legs. Its abdomen becomes larger, grooved, and is attached to its thorax by a black structure. A similar black structure connects its head and thorax. The stinger on its abdomen is now a pale yellow, with black stripes over its entire body. Fast-acting poison is stored in the stingers on its limbs, while the tail stinger produces a slow-acting poison used to finish opponents. The instantaneous poisons are instead used to prevent the foe from fleeing.[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMega Beedrill\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nBeedrill evolves from Kakuna and is the final form of Weedle.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nWeedle\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nKakuna\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nBeedrill\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Super Mystery Dungeon: Two Beedrill and three female Combee act as bosses of Nectar Meadow, having misinterpreted Budew, the player, and the partner as honey thieves.

Beedrill later helped Yellow when facing Lance at Cerise Island in the Yellow arc. In PS616, Giovanni's Beedrill was revealed to be able to Mega Evolve into Mega Beedrill.

When a Pok\u00e9 Ball was opened, one would come out and fly away. A few seconds later, a whole swarm would fly by and attack everyone on the field with Take Down except the user. Its role was taken over by Unown in Super Smash Bros. Melee.\n\nTrivia\nBeedrill's English name was originally going to be spelled Beedril.\nBeedrill can be seen as a parallel to Butterfree. Both of their unevolved stages evolve into their respective first evolutionary stages at level 7, which then evolve into their respective final forms at level 10. They both also go through metamorphosis-like evolution and share a base stat total of 395. Also, while Beedrill is a version exclusive of Black and Black 2, Butterfree is exclusive to White and White 2. Both also have an alternate form only available in-battle (Mega Beedrill and Gigantamax Butterfree, respectively).\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Conquest, Beedrill is the only Pok\u00e9mon that is featured without its evolutionary relatives.\nMega Beedrill has the highest base Attack and Speed stats of all Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon. It also has the lowest base Special Attack stat of all Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nBeedrill and its pre-evolved form, Kakuna, are the only yellow Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nConcept and development\nBeedrill and its pre-evolutions were designed by Atsuko Nishida.[2]\nMega Beedrill was designed by Hitoshi Ariga.[3]\n\nOrigin\nBeedrill seems to be based on a bee or wasp, possibly the Japanese honey bee, Asian giant hornet, or yellowjacket. Its pointed arms resemble spears, while Mega Beedrill swaps them for lances. Its Shiny color scheme is similar to metallic green sweat bees.\nBeedrill's parallels to Butterfree could possibly be a reference to the phrase \"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee\", which was coined by American boxer Muhammad Ali. This is further backed by the phrase being used in two episodes[4] of the English dub of the Pok\u00e9mon animated series as \"floating like a Butterfree and stinging like a Beedrill\".\n\nName origin\nBeedrill may be a combination of bee and drill.\nSpear is literally spear. It may also be derived from \u30a2\u30d4\u30b9 Apis (the genus name of the honey bee) spelled backwards.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b9\u30d4\u30a2\u30fc Spear\n\nFrom spear and possibly Apis spelled backwards\n\n\n French\n\nDardargnan\n\nFrom d'Artagnan, dard, and dare-dare\n\n\n Spanish\n\nBeedrill\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nBibor\n\nFrom Biene and Bohrer\n\n\n Italian\n\nBeedrill\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub3c5\uce68\ubd95 Tokchimbung\n\nFrom \ub3c5\uce68 (\u6bd2\u91dd) dokchim and \ubd95 bung or \ubd09 (\u8702) bong\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5927\u91dd\u8702 / \u5927\u9488\u8702 D\u00e0zh\u0113nf\u0113ng\n\nFrom \u5927 d\u00e0, \u8702\u91dd / \u8702\u9488 f\u0113ngzh\u0113n, and \u871c\u8702 m\u00ecf\u0113ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5927\u91dd\u8702 Daaihj\u0101mf\u016bng\n\nFrom \u5927 daaih, \u8702\u91dd f\u016bngj\u0101m, and \u871c\u8702 mahtf\u016bng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d1\u05d9\u05d3\u05e8\u05d9\u05dc Beedril\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092c\u0940\u0921\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0932 Beedrill\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hungarian\n\n\u00d3ri\u00e1sm\u00e9h*\n\n\"Giant bee\"\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nBitril\u0117\n\nFrom English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0411\u0438\u0434\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043b Bidrill\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e2a\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e35\u0e22\u0e23\u0e4c Sapia\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nAsh's/Casey's Beedrill\nGoh's Beedrill\nGiovanni's Beedrill\nMega Evolution\nWeaponry in the Pok\u00e9mon world\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire site | Mega Beedrill (archived)\n\n\u2191 Interview with Atsuko Nishida on Game Freak's website\n\n\u2191 Tweet by \u3042\u308a\u304c\u3072\u3068\u3057/ArigaHitoshi (@ariga_megamix).
