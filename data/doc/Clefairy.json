A small, pointed tooth protrudes from the upper left corner of its mouth. It has wrinkles beside its black, oval eyes, a single dark pink oval marking on each cheek, and large, pointed ears with brown tips. A tuft of fur curls over its forehead, much like its large, upward-curling tail. Each stocky arm has two small claws and a thumb on each hand, and both feet have a single toenail. There is a pair of tiny, butterfly-shaped wings on its back. Though incapable of flight, Clefairy's wings can store moonlight and allow it to float.\nClefairy is very shy and rarely shows itself to humans. On the rare occasions that Clefairy comes down from its mountain home, it can be seen dancing underneath the full moon's light. The area surrounding their dance is enveloped in a magnetic field. Once the sun rises, it returns home, where it sleeps nestled with other Clefairy. There have been many sightings of Clefairy during the morning aftermath of the full moon. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Clefairy Tales, Clefairy is depicted as an extraterrestrial Pok\u00e9mon. Clefairy is known to be popular thanks to both its adorable look and behavior. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, anyone who sees a Clefairy using Metronome while sleeping will receive happiness. This sighting is considered to be a very unusual sight to witness.[1]\nBefore Generation V, Clefairy and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Magic Guard as an Ability.\n\n\nEvolution\nClefairy evolves from Cleffa and evolves into Clefable.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nCleffa\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nClefairy\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nClefable\u00a0Fairy\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Stadium: Clefairy stars in the mini-game \"Clefairy Says.\" Players are given a pattern of arrows to repeat back.

Ash and his friends first encountered them after their spacecraft crash-landed near Viridian City. The Clefairy resorted to stealing items, including Jigglypuff's signature microphone marker and even Pikachu, from a nearby town to rebuild their spaceship.\nThe group, accompanied by Oswald and Jigglypuff, tracked the Clefairy to an underground cave and stormed the spaceship to recover Jigglypuff's microphone and Pikachu. Though Jigglypuff ended up defeating all of the Clefairy with Pound, the spacecraft still took off because of its preset launch, though Ash, his friends, and Jigglypuff escaped in time. Oswald remained on board until the spaceship crashed again in another village. As a result, the Clefairy once again began stealing the locals' items to return to orbit.\nThe Clefairy reappeared in Wish Upon a Star Shape, where the group re-encountered them after their spacecraft crashed into a Johto mountainside. Prior to the crash-landing, the Clefairy beamed a Cleffa to safety, and it landed on Ash's Phanpy. Cleffa quickly struck up a friendship with Phanpy. It later led everyone to the crash site while also trying to escape Team Rocket and the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Club (PMC).\nThe Clefairy went on to use the parts from Team Rocket's mecha and the PMC's machine to repair their spacecraft. Pikachu's Thunderbolt ultimately helped the craft lift off. In the process, Cleffa evolved into a Clefairy and reunited with its family.\nIts known moves are Light Screen, Double Slap, and Pound.\n\nLusamine's Clefairy\n Lusamine's Clefairy in Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon\nLusamine's Clefairy appeared in a fantasy in A Dream Encounter!, where she evolved into a Clefable. She reappeared during flashbacks in Mission: Total Recall!, where she was seen playing with Lillie. She reappeared again in another flashback in Rescuing the Unwilling!.\n\nOther\nMultiple Clefairy debuted in Clefairy and the Moon Stone, where some of them evolved into Clefable after touching the Moon Stone.\nA Clefairy appeared in A Goldenrod Opportunity, under the ownership of Whitney.

Melee\nClefairy reappears in Super Smash Bros. Melee, although Metronome has been modified to consist of four, random attacks:\n\nGust: Any character caught in the whirlwind will take heavy amount of damage, but not enough to KO them. This can be SDI'd out of, allowing characters to escape or reduce damage taken.\nFire Spin: This attack burns the ground around Clefairy, damaging any opponent caught in it. Like Gust, this can be SDI'd out of.\nWaterfall: This attack has high vertical knockback, large range, and hits many times, to the point that it can KO a character.\nSelf-Destruct: This attack is similar to Electrode's Explosion. Any character caught in the blast radius will take damage.\nAs in Smash 64, the summoner is immune to damage from Clefairy's attacks, including Self-Destruct. Its Japanese voice clip comes from a different part of Clefairy and the Moon Stone while its English voice clip is the same one used in Smash 64.\n\nTrophy information\nClefairy are very cute Pok\u00e9mon, which makes them popular pets. However, as they're only found in a few areas, it takes a lot of work to find one. Strangely enough, legend has it that Clefairy are more active during the full moon. These Pok\u00e9mon are known to use Metronome, a move that unleashes a randomly selected technique.\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nClefairy appears as a Spirit.\n\nTrivia\nThe prototype name for Clefairy was Aria. The Russian dub of Pok\u00e9mon the Series used this name during the original series.\nThe Polish dub of the episode Clefairy and the Moon Stone calls Clefairy by its proper species name and \"Aria\" interchangeably.\nClefairy and its evolved form share their category with Snubbull and Granbull. They are all known as the Fairy Pok\u00e9mon.\nThe \"Fairy Pok\u00e9mon\" category predates the introduction of the Fairy-type in Generation VI. From this generation onwards, the type and category of these four Pok\u00e9mon share the same English name. However, this is not true in Japanese, where the type is \u30d5\u30a7\u30a2\u30ea\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7 Fairy-type and the category is \u3088\u3046\u305b\u3044\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3 Y\u014dsei Pok\u00e9mon.\nThe Pok\u00e9 Doll is a Clefairy doll, as identified by the Japanese name of this item (\u30d4\u30c3\u30d4\u306b\u3093\u304e\u3087\u3046 Pippi Doll).\nConcept and development\nAccording to an interview, Clefairy was designed by Ken Sugimori, and is one of K\u014dji Nishino's favorite Pok\u00e9mon.[3]\n\nOrigin\nClefairy seems to be based on fairies and pixies since it is a playful, magical, humanoid creature with wings. It may also be inspired by the concept of extraterrestrial life due to its rumored celestial origins and vaguely star-shaped body.
