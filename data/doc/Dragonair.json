It has a rounded snout, oval purple eyes, and a small, white horn on its forehead. On each side of its head is a small, stylized wing, which is white and curves into a swirl at the base. Three blue, crystal orbs adorn its body: one on its neck and two on its tail.\nDragonair emits a gentle aura that gives it a mystical appearance. As seen in Pikachu's Rescue Adventure, it can make its wings grow larger in order to fly, but otherwise moves through the air unaided. Dragonair hosts a large amount of energy within its body, which it can discharge through the crystals on its neck and tail. This causes its body to brighten and give off a different aura that changes the weather in its vicinity. As a result, Dragonair has been referred as a \"divine Pok\u00e9mon\" since ancient times by agricultural peoples. Dragonair is a rare Pok\u00e9mon that inhabits pristine seas and lakes. The lakes Dragonair lives in are usually filled with offerings from people in gratitude. It is said that a person who sees a Dragonair at the start of a year will be healthy for the whole year. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Dragonair is known to channel power and change the weather even while it sleeps.[1]\nIn Generation II, Dragonair and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Outrage, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding.\n\nEvolution\nDragonair evolves from Dratini and evolves into Dragonite.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nDratini\u00a0Dragon\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nDragonair\u00a0Dragon\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nDragonite\u00a0Dragon\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #148\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nA mystical Pok\u00e9mon that exudes a gentle aura.

It managed to take out all of Giovanni's Pok\u00e9mon. Dragonair then evolved into a Dragonite when Clefairy pulled its tail.\n\nIn the TCG\nMain article: Dragonair (TCG)\nTrivia\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue beta, Dragonair was originally known as \"Dragyn\".\nAccording to the radio drama The Birth of Mewtwo, Dragonair was scientifically registered by a Pok\u00e9mon discovery ship 1001 about 200 nautical miles away from the open sea of Seafoam Islands.\nIn Blackthorn City, a woman is willing to trade her RhydonGS or DodrioCHGSS for a female Dragonair. This makes Dragonair the only Pok\u00e9mon able to be male or female that must be a specific gender for an in-game trade.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Yellow, Dragonair's catch rate was changed from 45 to 27, making it the hardest Pok\u00e9mon to catch in the Kanto Safari Zone. In the later games, the catch rate was changed back to 45.\nDragonair is also the former name of an airline based in Hong Kong in the real world.\nIn Generation I and Generation II, Dratini and Dragonair can learn Hyper Beam via leveling up, but not via TM. This was fixed in Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire.\nDragonair and its evolutionary relatives share their category with Horsea, its evolved forms, Salamence, and Kalosian Goodra. They are all known as the Dragon Pok\u00e9mon.\nOrigin\nDragonair appears to be based on sea serpents or ryu, traditional Japanese dragons or Chinese dragons who bring good luck. It also resembles a snake, its tail even resembling that of a rattlesnake. The wings on its head resemble those on the sandals and hat of the Greek god Hermes, and its long, snakelike body may be a reference to the snakes on his scepter.\nDragonair may also be based on the imugi, a proto-dragon that resembles a snake and lives in water or caves, much like Dragonair. After an imugi lives a thousand years, a jewel (called a Yeouiju) will fall from the sky. If the imugi catches it, it will become a true dragon. The jewels on Dragonair's neck and tail might also be a reference to Chinese dragons' associations with pearls, specifically, the flaming pearl often placed under dragon's chin which symbolizes prosperity, power, immortality, thunder, and grants wishes.\n\nName origin\nDragonair may be a combination of dragon and air, debonair, or lair (traditional home of a dragon).\nHakury\u016b may be derived from \u767d\u7adc hakury\u016b (white dragon).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30cf\u30af\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc Hakuryu\n\nFrom \u767d\u7adc hakury\u016b\n\n\n French\n\nDraco\n\nFrom draco\n\n\n Spanish\n\nDragonair\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nDragonir\n\nFrom the English name and possibly Fafnir\n\n\n Italian\n\nDragonair\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc2e0\ub1fd Sinnyong\n\nFrom \uc2e0 (\u795e) sin and \ub1fd (\u9f8d) nyong\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u54c8\u514b\u9f8d / \u54c8\u514b\u9f99 H\u0101k\u00e8l\u00f3ng\n\nFrom the partial transcription of the Japanese name and \u9f8d / \u9f99 l\u00f3ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u54c8\u514b\u9f8d H\u0101h\u0101kl\u00f9hng*\u54c8\u53e4\u9f8d H\u0101g\u00fal\u00f9hng*\n\nFrom the partial transcription of the Japanese name and \u9f8d l\u00f9hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0921\u094d\u0930\u0948\u0917\u0928\u0947\u092f\u0930 Dragonair\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0414\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044d\u0439\u0440 Dragoneyr\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e2e\u0e32\u0e04\u0e38\u0e23\u0e34\u0e27 Hakhurio\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nClair's Dragonair\nLance's Dragonair\nAsh's Dragonite\nDragonite (UNITE)\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0147: Dratini\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0149: Dragonite\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Dragonair_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4142988\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monDragon-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Slow experience groupBlue-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 02 Pok\u00e9monWater 1 group Pok\u00e9monDragon group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Paldea Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 420Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became both Special Attack and Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 19 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that run from battle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 11 October 2024, at 14:05.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
