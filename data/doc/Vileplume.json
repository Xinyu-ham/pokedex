It has beady red eyes and a small mouth, and its head and torso are a single joined segment. On its head is a massive red flower with five bulky petals and an orange-brown center. Vileplume's flower is said to have the largest petals in the world and is almost too heavy for the Pok\u00e9mon itself to support. The rounded petals of the flower are red and covered with white spots. A female Vileplume has fewer, but larger, spots on its petals. When defeated in the side series games, Vileplume's body appears to either deflate or withers while the flower remains.\nVileplume can shake, flap, or burst its petals into bloom with a bang in order to release clouds of pollen. This pollen is yellow and highly allergenic to humans, and toxic to other Pok\u00e9mon; Vileplume uses it to paralyze its prey before devouring it. The larger the Vileplume's petals are, the more potent the toxin on its pollen is. Vileplume's behavior of flapping its petals also makes very loud noises. In Generation I, Petal Dance was its signature move. Being the result of an Evolution via Evolution stone, Vileplume is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in grassy plains. It is often mistaken for local flowers in the wild.\n\nEvolution\nVileplume evolves from Gloom and is one of the final forms of Oddish, the other being Bellossom.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nOddish\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nGloom\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nVileplume\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #045\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nThe larger its petals, the more toxic pollen it contains.

They are all known as the Flower Pok\u00e9mon.\nAlthough Vileplume has the Chlorophyll Ability, the Rafflesia genus of plants that it is based on do not actually contain chlorophyll.\nThe symbol for the Jungle expansion  resembles Vileplume's flower.\nOrigin\n  Bulbanews has an article related to this subject: On the Origin of Species: Gloom and Vileplume  \nVileplume seems to be based on a mandrake, plants from the Mandragora genus whose roots sometimes resemble human figures; and Rafflesia, a genus of parasitic plants known for their large, foul smelling flowers. It is especially similar to Rafflesia arnoldii, which produces the largest single flower on Earth. Female Vileplume resemble Rafflesia hasseltii due to the larger spots on their petals.\nIts habit of attracting prey with its petals before immobilizing and devouring them is similar to the behavior of various carnivorous plants.\n\nName origin\nVileplume may be a combination of vile and plume (object that resembles a feather; cloud of dispersed substance) or bloom.\nRuffresia may be derived from Rafflesia.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30e9\u30d5\u30ec\u30b7\u30a2 Ruffresia\n\nFrom Rafflesia\n\n\n French\n\nRafflesia\n\nFrom Rafflesia\n\n\n Spanish\n\nVileplume\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nGiflor\n\nFrom Gift and Flor\n\n\n Italian\n\nVileplume\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub77c\ud50c\ub808\uc2dc\uc544 Raplresia\n\nFrom Rafflesia\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u9738\u738b\u82b1 B\u00e0w\u00e1nghu\u0101\n\nFrom \u9738\u738b\u82b1 b\u00e0w\u00e1nghu\u0101 which combines \u9738\u738b b\u00e0w\u00e1ng and \u82b1 hu\u0101\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u9738\u738b\u82b1 Baw\u00f2hngf\u0101\n\nFrom \u9738\u738b\u82b1 baw\u00f2hngf\u0101 which combines \u9738\u738b baw\u00f2hng and \u82b1 f\u0101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0935\u093e\u0907\u0932\u092a\u094d\u0932\u0942\u092e Vileplume\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Icelandic\n\nGrimmdarfj\u00f6\u00f0ur*\n\nFrom grimmdar and fj\u00f6\u00f0ur\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nVilaplamas\n\nFrom the English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0412\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043f\u043b\u044e\u043c Vaylplyum\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1f\u0e40\u0e1f\u0e23\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e22 Rapfresia\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0044: Gloom\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0046: Paras\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Vileplume_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128729\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monGrass-type Pok\u00e9monPoison-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Slow experience groupRed-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 12 Pok\u00e9monGrass group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Hoenn Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Blueberry Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 480Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 490Pok\u00e9mon whose base Special Attack stat is greater than 100Pok\u00e9mon with 16 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon whose base stats changed in Generation VI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 16:26.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
