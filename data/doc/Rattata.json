It has purple fur with a cream-colored face, paws, and underbelly. It has narrow eyes containing white sclera and pupil with red irises, rounded ears with cream-colored insides, and a single whisker on each cheek. Its long tail is tightly curled at the end. Its most notable feature is its large teeth. Like most rodents, its teeth grow continuously throughout its life and must be worn down by gnawing. This also ensures that Rattata is not awoken by the sound of its grinding teeth while sleeping. Females will have shorter whiskers.\nRattata can live wherever it can find food, which it searches for most of the day. Thanks to its sharp fangs, it is able to chew on nearly anything. When it is threatened, Rattata can deliver a powerful bite. Rattata constantly keep their ears up and will immediately scurry away from the slightest sound. Furret is the natural predator of Rattata. Its hardiness lets it live in many environments, although it mainly lives on plains and savannas. Because it reproduces so quickly, a pair of Rattata can quickly colonize an area. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Rattata is known to sleep sometimes with a log in its mouth.[1]\nPrior to Generation IV, Rattata and its evolved form, Raticate, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Hyper Fang and Super Fang.\n\nForms\nRattata has a regional form: Alolan Rattata.\nRattata are non-native to Alola and arrived in cargo ships. The Rattata population in Alola was booming until Yungoos and Gumshoos were imported as a control measure. In order to avoid these new predators, Rattata altered its habits. It moved to more urban areas, became nocturnal, and formed large nests led by Raticate.[2] Alolan Rattata searches out fresh food by smell and ignores anything spoiled. It has even been known to sneak into people's homes to find food. It has dark gray fur and grayish-purple ear insides. There are two tufts of fur on each ear and near the tip of its tail. Its long, thin whiskers are also replaced by shorter, thicker tufts of fur. The line where its cream underbelly meets its gray fur is ragged instead of smooth. Unlike its Kantonian form, it is sometimes shown as bipedal rather than being in fours.\n\nEvolution\nRattata evolves into Raticate.\nAlolan Rattata evolves into Alolan Raticate.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\nRattata\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nRattata\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nRaticate\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlolan Rattata\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nRattataAlolan Form\u00a0Dark\u00a0\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nRaticateAlolan Form\u00a0Dark\u00a0\u00a0Normal\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #019\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nBites anything when it attacks.

They are all known as the Mouse Pok\u00e9mon, though Rattata and Raticate were originally called the Rat Pok\u00e9mon prior to Generation III.\nRattata has gained notoriety among the fanbase due to Youngster Joey on Route 30, and his phone calls claiming his Rattata to be within the top percentage of the species.\nRattata has the lowest base HP of all Normal-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nAlolan Rattata has the lowest base HP and Special Attack of all Dark-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nAlolan Rattata ties with Morpeko for the shortest Dark-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nAlolan Rattata may be considered a counterpart of Yungoos. They can be caught at certain times of the day (Yungoos at day, Alolan Rattata at night). They also evolve into Gumshoos and Alolan Raticate, respectively, at level 20 at their respective times. Also, their evolved forms are the Totem Pok\u00e9mon in their respective games (Gumshoos in Sun and Ultra Sun, Raticate in Moon and Ultra Moon).\nAlolan Rattata and its evolution are the only regional forms that cannot be transferred out of Pok\u00e9mon HOME into any Generation VIII or Generation IX game.\nTogether with Magikarp, Seedot, Ninjask, Pichu, and Goldeen, Rattata is the easiest Pok\u00e9mon to catch in Pok\u00e9mon Ranger, with only one loop necessary.\nOrigin\nRattata appears to be based on a rat or a mouse. It may draw visual inspiration from hairy-tailed packrats.\nAlolan Rattata appears to be based on the black rat, brown rat, or Polynesian rat, all of which are invasive species in Hawaii. Their attacks on sugar cane fields caused the locals to import the Small Indian mongoose into Hawaii as a form of pest control, explaining the relationship between Yungoos/Gumshoos and Rattata/Raticate. Its thieving behavior and tendency to work in groups under the command of a Raticate are reminiscent of a gangster. The shape of its whiskers resembles the knot of a hokkamuri \u2014 a cloth wrapped around the head and tied under nose as a form of disguise, typically worn by thieves in Japanese media for comedic effect.\n\nName origin\nRattata may be a combination of rat and attack, as indicated by its beta name. It may also incorporate rat-a-tat (a tapping sound).\nKoratta may be a combination of \u5b50 ko (child) or \u5c0f ko (small) and rat.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b3\u30e9\u30c3\u30bf Koratta\n\nFrom \u5b50 ko, \u5c0f ko, and rat\n\n\n French\n\nRattata\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Spanish\n\nRattata\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nRattfratz\n\nFrom Ratte and Fratz\n\n\n Italian\n\nRattata\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uaf2c\ub81b Koret\n\nFrom \uaf2c\ub9c8 kkoma, \uaf2c\ub9ac kkori, and rat\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5c0f\u62c9\u9054 / \u5c0f\u62c9\u8fbe Xi\u01ceol\u0101d\u00e1\n\nFrom \u5c0f xi\u01ceo and \u62c9\u9054 / \u62c9\u8fbe L\u0101d\u00e1\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5c0f\u62c9\u9054 S\u00edul\u0101aidaaht*\u5c0f\u54e5\u9054 S\u00edug\u014ddaaht*\n\nFrom \u5c0f s\u00edu and \u62c9\u9054 L\u0101aidaahtFrom \u5c0f s\u00edu and \u54e5\u9054 G\u014ddaaht\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05e8\u05d8\u05d8\u05d4 Ratata\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0930\u0948\u091f\u0948\u091f\u093e Rattata\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nRatata\n\nFrom English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0420\u0430\u0442\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 Rattata\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e42\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e15\u0e15\u0e32 Khoratta\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nRatty\nRegional form\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Rattata\n\n\nExternal links\n\n Alolan forms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: Regional forms (Alolan \u2022 Galarian \u2022 Hisuian \u2022 Paldean) \u2022 Ecologically similar Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0018: Pidgeot\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0020: Raticate\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Rattata_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4128830\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monNormal-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monDark-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupPurple-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 08 Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with different formsField group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a two-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Unova Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 253Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became their Special AttackPok\u00e9mon with 17 max performance starsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9monBlack-colored Pok\u00e9monF.E.A.R.-compatible Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that evolve based on timePok\u00e9mon that evolve only at night\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 27 September 2024, at 16:28.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
