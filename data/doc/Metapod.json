Its body is crescent-shaped, with several segments making up the lower point. The front of Metapod's shell resembles a face with heavy-lidded eyes and a sharply pointed nose. The back of its shell consists of several geometrically shaped portions and projections.\nMetapod's soft body is protected by a hard outer shell as it undergoes metamorphosis. While this shell is said to be as hard as steel, a sudden, powerful impact could cause its liquid innards to pop out, leaving it completely exposed. Metapod generally remains motionless, rebuilding its cells for evolution. If an enemy discovers Metapod, it cannot do anything other than harden its outer shell. Metapod lives in temperate forests and jungles, often in groups. Pikipek is a natural predator of Metapod. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Metapod is known to sleep while using the move Harden constantly to protect its innards. It stays still while sleeping to avoid getting attacked by foes[1].\n\nEvolution\nMetapod evolves from Caterpie and evolves into Butterfree.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nCaterpie\u00a0Bug\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nMetapod\u00a0Bug\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nButterfree\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team: Metapod is Caterpie's friend.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #011\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon is vulnerable to attack while its shell is soft, exposing its weak and tender body.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nHardens its shell to protect itself.

He eventually evolved into Butterfree in Challenge of the Samurai, following an attack by a horde of Beedrill.\nMetapod also appeared in I Choose You!, which is set in a different continuity from Pok\u00e9mon the Series. He evolved from Caterpie during a battle against a Pinsir and later evolved into Butterfree after a battle against a group of Primeape.\n\nOther\nIn Challenge of the Samurai, Samurai's Metapod battled Ash's own Metapod, but because both Metapod only knew Harden, the battle went on for hours until a swarm of Beedrill forced the battle to end.\nIn Gettin' The Bugs Out, Bugsy used a Metapod during his Gym battle against Ash, facing Chikorita and Pikachu before being defeated by the latter's Thunderbolt. Unlike most Metapod, this one was actually able to fight back by using Tackle. More Metapod were seen inside the Azalea Gym in the same episode.\nA Metapod appeared in Caterpie's Big Dilemma, under the ownership of Zander. It became giant after eating some enhanced Rare Candies. Zander's Caterpie knocked down part of a radio tower in order to make a place for it to evolve into Metapod. It later evolved again to become a Butterfree.\nIn Butterfree and Me!, multiple Metapod evolved into Butterfree on Wayfarer Island. One Metapod had been befriended by Ash as a Caterpie, and Ash helped it eventually evolve into Butterfree.\n\nMinor appearances\nIn Celebi: The Voice of the Forest, Ash and Sam witnessed multiple Metapod evolving into Butterfree.\nA Metapod appeared in The Breeding Center Secret.\nIn Tracey Gets Bugged, a Metapod was among the Bug-type populace of Murcott Island.\nA wild Metapod appeared in Pikachu's Rescue Adventure.\nIn Illusion Confusion!, a Metapod was one of the illusions created by a group of Haunter and Gengar.\nA Metapod appeared in Gonna Rule The School!, under the ownership of the Pok\u00e9mon Trainers' School.

It evolved prior to Gold And Black VS. Team Rocket.\n\nIn the TCG\nMain article: Metapod (TCG)\nOther appearances\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nMetapod appears as a Spirit.\n\nTrivia\n Metapod's Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire artwork, showing it with yellow schlerae\nMetapod shares its category with Kakuna, Silcoon, and Cascoon. They are all known as the Cocoon Pok\u00e9mon.\nThey also share the same base stat total, learnset, Ability, and EV yield.\nThis ties them as the evolved Pok\u00e9mon with the lowest base stat total.\nMetapod is the first Pok\u00e9mon to evolve in a movie, and part of the first evolution cycle in an episode.\nUntil the release of Pok\u00e9mon Platinum, when its pre-evolution became able to learn Bug Bite, Metapod was unable to damage Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon except by using Struggle. It shared this trait with Caterpie. This is also true for Kakuna and its pre-evolution, Weedle, against Steel types before Pok\u00e9mon Platinum was released.\nDue to this, it is impossible to complete a Generation I game using only Caterpie or Metapod, since Struggle cannot hit Ghost types in this generation.\nMetapod is usually depicted with white sclerae, such as in the games, TCG, and promotional illustrations, but it has yellow sclerae in Pok\u00e9mon the Series.\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Challenge of the Samurai, the process of Metapod's evolution was similar to a real life butterfly emerging from its chrysalis. However, in later episodes,[2] Metapod is shown to evolve like any other Pok\u00e9mon.\nUme Aoki, a Japanese cartoonist famous for her work on the manga Hidamari Sketch and as the character designer for the anime Puella Magi Madoka Magica, utilizes a likeness of herself cosplaying as a Metapod to represent herself in her works.\nOrigin\nMetapod seems to be based on a butterfly chrysalis, possibly that of the cabbage white butterfly due to its pointed shape and green color.\n\nName origin\nMetapod may be a combination of metamorphosis and pod (a shell containing seeds).\nTransel may be a combination of transform and cell or possibly a pun on \u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30bb\u30eb randoseru (school bag).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30bb\u30eb Transel\n\nFrom transform and cell, as well as a pun on \u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30bb\u30eb randoseru\n\n\n French\n\nChrysacier\n\nFrom chrysalide and acier\n\n\n Spanish\n\nMetapod\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nSafcon\n\nFrom Safe and Kokon\n\n\n Italian\n\nMetapod\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub2e8\ub370\uae30 Tandegi\n\nFrom \ub2e8\ub2e8\ud558\ub2e4 dandanhada and \ubc88\ub370\uae30 beondegi\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u9435\u7532\u86f9 / \u94c1\u7532\u86f9 Ti\u011bji\u01cey\u01d2ng\n\nFrom \u9435\u7532 / \u94c1\u7532 Ti\u011bji\u01ce and \u86f9 y\u01d2ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u9435\u7532\u86f9 Titgaapy\u00fang*\u9435\u7532\u87f2 Titgaapch\u00f9hng*\n\nFrom \u9435\u7532 titgaap and \u86f9 y\u00fangFrom \u9435\u7532 titgaap and \u87f2 ch\u00f9hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05de\u05d8\u05e4\u05d5\u05d3 Metapod\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092e\u0947\u091f\u093e\u092a\u0949\u0921 Metapod\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nMetapodas\n\nFrom English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0434 Metapod\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e17\u0e23\u0e32\u0e19\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e25 Thransel\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nAsh's Metapod\nKitty\nMetapod (Red and Blue Rescue Team)\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Sleep Style Dex\n\n\u2191 Caterpie's Big Dilemma, Butterfree and Me!\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0010: Caterpie\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0012: Butterfree\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Metapod_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4148163\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monBug-type Pok\u00e9monSingle-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon without Hidden AbilitiesPok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupGreen-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 02 Pok\u00e9monBug group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Alola Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Galar Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 205Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became both Special Attack and Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 15 max performance starsPok\u00e9mon that cannot learn TMsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 18 October 2024, at 00:37.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
