It is mostly blue with a yellow underbelly, and it has a row of yellow spots down each side. Its mouth is very large and gaping, bearing four pointed teeth and yellow lips. It has one pair of barbel and a small white fin on each side of its face. The barbels are white on a female and blue on a male. It has small, red eyes, a three-pointed, dark blue crest on its head, and four white, spiky dorsal fins. Gyarados's tail fin is similar in structure to the crest on its head, except with a thin, white fin spread between the points.\nThe process of evolution causes a change in its brain structure that is believed to cause its violent nature. Gyarados's fangs can crush stones and its scales are harder than steel. Gyarados is feared for its fierce temper and wanton destructive tendencies since ancient times. In some regions, Gyarados is called the \"deity of destruction\" because of this. It appears in times of conflict and destroys the surrounding area. Its rampages have been known to last a month at a time. These rampages can occur even during a harsh storm. A Gyarados's rage won't stop completely until everything is destroyed. Some believed any human settlement is fated to be destroyed should a Gyarados appear. Gyarados lives in both fresh and salty waters. Both Gyarados and its Mega form have demonstrated in Pok\u00e9mon Chronicles and Pok\u00e9mon the Series that it can leap huge distances both from the water[1] and from the ground[2], usually several times its own body length. However, Gyarados is rarely seen in the wild. The move Hyper Beam is often associated with Gyarados due to it being being powerful enough to instantly destroy everything it hits.\n\nForms\nGyarados can Mega Evolve into Mega Gyarados.\nWhen it Mega Evolves, Gyarados becomes bulkier. The fins on its cheeks become longer and gain a yellow tint. Its crest is larger and black, and its barbels also gain considerable length. A large spike extends downward underneath its chin, and it now has a black underside with a red stripe around the edges. The yellow spots along its body are replaced by raised red scales, which propel Mega Gyarados through the water. Two large yellow fins with blue spines appear on its back. Most of the other fins along its back disappear, replaced by two rows of blue spikes. There are now four yellowish, spiky fins near its tail: two on its back and two on its underside.\nDue the stress Mega Evolution puts on a Gyarados's body, it becomes even more ferocious than before. All other brain functions cease when Mega Evolution occurs, except for the destructive drive to burn down anything into cinders. Despite its brain having a powerful destructive instinct, it will obey a Trainer it truly trusts. Mega Gyarados can launch at Mach Speed by using its orifices to release water from both sides. With this speed, it has enough power to split large ships in two. Mega Gyarados is tied with Hoopa Unbound as the tallest Dark-type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMega Gyarados\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nGyarados evolves from Magikarp.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nMagikarp\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nGyarados\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Flying\u00a0\n\n\nGame data\nIn Diamond and Pearl, a red Gyarados is featured on the TV on a program called \"Search for the Red Gyarados.\" It is this that inspires Lucas or Dawn and their rival to go to Lake Verity, to see if there is a rare Pok\u00e9mon dwelling in it.\n\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time, Darkness and Sky: A Gyarados appears in the Miracle Sea. He scares off the Phione in order to claim the Phione Dew, but is stopped by the player's team.\nPok\u00e9Park Wii: Pikachu's Adventure: Gyarados tries to take over the Beach Zone in Empoleon's absence. Pikachu then has to beat Gyarados's Aqua Dash so Gyarados stops trying to take over.\nPok\u00e9mon: Magikarp Jump: The player's Magikarp may evolve into Gyarados as part of the \"Adios, Gyarados!\" and \"Macho Karp\" random events. However, once it evolves into Gyarados, it is forced to retire.\nPokk\u00e9n Tournament: Gyarados has been shown in the background of the Magikarp Festival stage as an NPC background Pok\u00e9mon.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #130\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nRarely seen in the wild.

When it does appear, it's usually running rampant in a destructive rage--behavior that has the unfortunate side effect of leaving whole cities in ruin. It is said that when humans begin a conflict, Gyarados incinerates the towns of both warring parties. There are records of a Gyarados rampage lasting as long as a month. Its pre-evolution form is Magikarp.\"\n\nSuper Smash Bros. Ultimate\nGyarados appears as a Spirit.\n\nPOK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu\nA Gyarados appeared in POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu. It was first seen as a Magikarp, but it eventually evolved and scared away a Charizard in order to protect Tim Goodman and Detective Pikachu.\n\nPok\u00e9mon UNITE\n Gyarados in Pok\u00e9mon UNITE\nMain article: Gyarados (UNITE)\nGyarados is playable through obtaining a Unite License. It is a melee all-rounder that starts as Magikarp, which evolves into Gyarados by either filling up an effort gauge or reaching level 7.\n\n\nTrivia\n Gyarados in Pok\u00e9mon Battle Chess\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue beta, Gyarados' name was \"Skulkraken\", a combination of skull and kraken (a mythological sea monster).\nThe radio drama The Birth of Mewtwo contains an audio footage of Gyarados' discovery by a female researcher which ends disturbingly.\nGyarados's original design resembled a massive leech-like creature without eyes.[3] Though this has now been debunked and is attributed to the myth of Namazu (read more below in Origin). The eyes can now be spotted as tiny dots.\nGyarados, Magikarp, and Regigigas are the three Pok\u00e9mon that can be encountered in the wild at the lowest and highest levels. In Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2, Gyarados can be found at levels ranging from level 1 to 100 in the Nature Preserve by using a Super Rod in rippling water.\nIn Generations II and IV, Gyarados is the first of only two Shiny Pok\u00e9mon to be integrated into a game's plot (the second was Celebi in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness and Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky).\nGyarados's Shiny form is the first Shiny Pok\u00e9mon to appear in the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga.\nGyarados and its pre-evolved form's Egg Group combination (Water 2 and Dragon) is unique.\nGyarados is the only Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon in the Water 2 Egg Group.\nDespite being part Flying-type, Gyarados couldn't learn any Flying-type moves naturally prior to Generation VII.\nGyarados is tied with Pelipper as the most common Pok\u00e9mon found amongst Gym Leaders, being used by seven of them.\nCoincidentally, both are Water and Flying-types.\nIn many ways, Gyarados is the counterpart of Milotic. Both are the serpentine evolved forms of weak fish Pok\u00e9mon, and both appear in times of conflict; Gyarados to destroy, Milotic to becalm. Both have base stat totals of 540, the only difference being the distribution of their Attack, Special Attack and Special Defense stats.\nGyarados is tied with Milotic for the greatest increase in base stat total after evolving, at 340 points.\nMega Gyarados is tied with Hoopa Unbound for being the tallest Dark-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nGyarados appears in Pok\u00e9mon Battle Chess. It doesn't behave like any traditional piece in chess. It is only present after Magikarp is damaged.\nGyarados has featured as multiple cultural references in the Pok\u00e9mon franchise including Koinobori in Pok\u00e9mon the Series and a 1997 May calendar insert, Shachihoko on a Nagoya Castle pin, Merlion from Pok\u00e9mon Center Singapore, and most historically as the Dragon Gate myth discussed further below.\nOrigin\n The unnamed Pok\u00e9mon resembling Mega Gyarados\nGyarados appears to be based on a sea dragon or sea serpent and a Chinese dragon. It is also partially based on a legend about how carp that leaped over the Dragon Gate would become dragons. Several waterfalls and cataracts in China are believed to be the location of the Dragon Gate such as the Longmen Mountains. This is referenced by Pok\u00e9mon Snap, as the player needs to get a Magikarp into a waterfall to evolve it into Gyarados but only after it leaps over a mountain. This legend is an allegory of the drive and efforts needed to overcome obstacles, which can be tied to the fact that Gyarados' pre-evolved form, Magikarp, could possibly take a lot of drive and effort to legitimately evolve into Gyarados.\nIt may be partially based on the kraken, as both are destructive sea monsters that are infamous for terrorizing humans. To add to this, one of Gyarados' original names was considered to be \"Skullkraken\". Gyarados's Flying type may be a reference to koinobori, a carp-shaped windsock traditionally flown to celebrate Children's Day in Japan, formerly called Tango no Sekku (\u7aef\u5348\u306e\u7bc0\u53e5). Though it is more likely to be associated with Eastern Dragons in general due to their associations to Water and the Sky - such as the Azure Dragon. It could also be inspired by the South African cryptid Inkanyamba, a giant, winged eel that causes storms when angry, a trait Gyarados is famous for.\nMega Gyarados' appearance bears similarities to the aforementioned koinobori. Furthermore, its design, specifically its large dorsal fins, strongly resembles that of the unnamed \"legendary water Pok\u00e9mon\" seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Enlighten Up!, first aired on April 18, 2002, in which Misty recounts seeing an unknown water Pok\u00e9mon. This creature may have inspired the design of Mega Gyarados when it was eventually created 10 years later.\nOn December 2018, the Beta Sprite for Gyarados was showcased on the NHK Broadcast in Japan bearing the resemblance of a worm-like body with a mouthful of sharp teeth, barbels on the top of its head, and multiple fins on the side of its body. The inspiration for this original design may be related to the myth of \u9bf0 Namazu or \u5927\u9bf0 \u014cnamazu from 16th century Japan. Namazu was known as a catfish that was said to destroy cities with earthquakes and appears during times of human conflict - much like Gyarados\u2019 Pokedex entries in the original first 2 generations of games. Namazu\u2019s history as a mythos is also directly tied to Lake Biwa - the real life version of the Lake of Rage - where said earthquakes were said to occur. This idea was later replaced with the Dragon Gate myth and rehashed in Gen 3 as the inspiration for Whiscash appropriately named \u30ca\u30de\u30ba\u30f3 \"Namazun\".\n\nName origin\nAccording to Ken Sugimori, Gyarados's name has no specific origin and was chosen merely for its \"force\".[4] However, it may be variously derived from \u8650\u6bba gyakusatsu (slaughter), \u9006\u5883 gyakky\u014d (adversity), or \u9006\u8ee2 gyakuten (reversal, turnaround); \u8352\u3089\u3059 arasu (to devastate); and \u8105\u3059 odosu (to threaten).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30ae\u30e3\u30e9\u30c9\u30b9 Gyarados\n\nFrom \u8650\u6bba gyakusatsu, \u9006\u5883 gyakky\u014d, or \u9006\u8ee2 gyakuten; \u8352\u3089\u3059 arasu; and \u8105\u3059 odosu\n\n\n French\n\nL\u00e9viator\n\nFrom Leviathan and or\n\n\n Spanish\n\nGyarados\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n German\n\nGarados\n\nSimilar to English/Japanese name\n\n\n Italian\n\nGyarados\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uac38\ub77c\ub3c4\uc2a4 Gyarados\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u66b4\u9bc9\u9f8d / \u66b4\u9ca4\u9f99 B\u00e0ol\u01d0l\u00f3ng\n\nFrom \u66b4 b\u00e0o, \u9bc9 / \u9ca4 l\u01d0, and \u9f8d / \u9f99 l\u00f3ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u66b4\u9bc9\u9f8d Bouhl\u00e9ihl\u00f9hng*\u9bc9\u9b5a\u9f8d L\u00e9ih'y\u00f9hl\u00f9hng*\n\nFrom \u66b4 bouh, \u9bc9 l\u00e9ih, and \u9f8d l\u00f9hngFrom \u9bc9\u9b5a l\u00e9ih'y\u00f9h and \u9f8d l\u00f9hng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Bulgarian\n\n\u0413\u0430\u0439\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441 Gairados\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Greek\n\n\u0393\u03ba\u03b1\u03ca\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 Gair\u00e1dos\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0917\u0948\u0930\u093e\u0921\u094b\u0938 Gyarados\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0413\u0438\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441 Giarados\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e40\u0e01\u0e35\u0e22\u0e23\u0e32\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e2a Kiaradot\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nMisty's Gyarados\nJames's Gyarados\nRed Gyarados\nLance's Gyarados\nGyara\nSilver's Gyarados\nGyarados (UNITE)\nMega Evolution\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Cerulean Blues\n\n\u2191 Coming Apart at the Dreams!\n\n\u2191 https://www.newsweek.com/pokemon-beta-designs-red-green-1265710\n\n\u2191 Tweet by \u6749\u68ee \u5efa (@SUPER_32X).
