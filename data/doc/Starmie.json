The front starfish has a golden formation in the center. In the center of the golden casing is its red jewel core, which can glow in seven colors and has developed to resemble a cut precious stone. The second starfish is semi-attached to the back of the first and can spin 360 degrees. This rotational action is how Starmie swims through the ocean. It can also launch itself out of the water and fly through the air for short periods, as seen in Pok\u00e9mon Snap.\nFrom its core, Starmie can emit electrical waves that are powerful enough to reach the furthest parts of the universe. The multi-color glowing of its core is also believed to be a method of communication with other members of its species. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Water Flowers of Cerulean City, the core will go dark if Starmie is knocked unconscious and will sometimes flicker if Starmie is low on health. Because of its body shape and habit of sending transmissions skyward, some people believe this Pok\u00e9mon to be extraterrestrial. It has been known to cause headaches on people when approached. It is rarely seen in the wild since it requires a rare evolution stone to evolve, but it can be found in the deepest parts of the ocean. It feeds by absorbing tiny plankton into its body while swimming, and it is preyed on by Lumineon.\n\nEvolution\nStarmie evolves from Staryu.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nStaryu\u00a0Water\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nStarmie\u00a0Water\u00a0\u00a0Psychic\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity: Starmie runs the Sunken Treasure mini-game in Pok\u00e9mon Paradise. In this mini-game, the player collects black, blue and red treasure chests by tilting their Nintendo 3DS. Chinchou and rocks appear as obstacles in this mini-game, and touching them deducts one treasure chest, starting with black chests. Unlike Treasure Boxes obtained from dungeons, they are opened upon obtaining. Starmie's mini-game can be played once every in-game day.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #121\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nIts central core glows with the seven colors of the rainbow.

In The Misty Mermaid, she left it at the Cerulean Gym for her sisters.\n\nOther\nIn Bye Bye Psyduck, Marina used a Starmie to battle the Golduck Misty believed was her Psyduck. It was defeated when the force of Golduck's Hyper Beam shattered its Light Screen.\nIn Misty Meets Her Match, Rudy used a Starmie in his battle against Ash.

Check!.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Zensho\nMain article: Misty's Starmie\nMisty sent out her Starmie for Satoshi's second Gym battle challenge in PZ03. However, it could not battle him as Satoshi had trouble dealing with water, and the battle was officially called off.\n\nIn the TCG\nMain article: Starmie (TCG)\nOther appearances\nSuper Smash Bros.\nWhen released from a Pok\u00e9 Ball, Starmie floats to the closest opponent and barrages them with Swift. Each hit does 3% damage, and touching Starmie itself does 12% damage. It has been replaced by its pre-evolved form Staryu in all future releases, in which it performs the same function.\n\nTrivia\nStaryu was programmed to learn Egg moves in Gold and Silver, but these moves were unobtainable because both Staryu and Starmie are gender unknown and so could only breed with Ditto. These moves were removed in Crystal.\nStaryu, Starmie, and Mew are the only Pok\u00e9mon species that are gender unknown but can legitimately learn Attract in Generation II. This move has no effect when used by these Pok\u00e9mon.\nIn the Japanese-exclusive Pok\u00e9mon Stadium, Starmie seems to have originally been a lot more rubbery than it is now, as its limbs stretch whenever it is hit.\nStarmie is the only Psychic-type Pok\u00e9mon in the Water 3 Egg Group.\nOrigin\nStarmie seems to be based on a stylized starfish such as the purple sea star (due to its color), the sunflower sea star (due to its many arms), or the Hefferman's starfish (due to its color and central pattern, especially in its Shiny form). Like Starmie, many real starfish have the ability to regenerate lost body parts. Given its ties to outer space and ability to emit light, it may also be based on literal stars and meteors. It is also reminiscent of ornate jewelry, with its central core resembling a faceted gem mounted inside a golden prong setting. The standard color of its gem resembles a ruby, while its Shiny color resembles a sapphire. Its tendency to rapidly spin its body is reminiscent of shuriken and propellers. Its gender unknown designation may be based on hermaphroditism, observed in some real-life starfish species.\nIts ability to learn various beam attacks and the gem in the middle acting like a heart might also be a reference to the Ultraman series, where Ultra Warriors have similar gems on their chests that start flashing when they are weak, just like Starmie's gem as shown in Pok\u00e9mon the Series.\n\nName origin\nStarmie may be a combinaton of star and mystery. Its name in English may also involve me (in opposition to the you in Staryu).\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30fc Starmie\n\nFrom star and mystery\n\n\n French\n\nStaross\n\nFrom star and boss\n\n\n Spanish\n\nStarmie\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n German\n\nStarmie\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Italian\n\nStarmie\n\nSame as English/Japanese name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc544\ucfe0\uc2a4\ud0c0 Akusta\n\nFrom aqua and star\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5bf6\u77f3\u6d77\u661f / \u5b9d\u77f3\u6d77\u661f B\u01ceosh\u00edh\u01ceix\u012bng\n\nFrom \u5bf6\u77f3 / \u5b9d\u77f3 b\u01ceosh\u00ed and \u6d77\u661f h\u01ceix\u012bng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5bf6\u77f3\u6d77\u661f B\u00f3usehkh\u00f3is\u012bng\n\nFrom \u5bf6\u77f3 b\u00f3usehk and \u6d77\u661f h\u00f3is\u012bng\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0938\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0930\u092e\u0940 Starmie\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0438 Starmi\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e21\u0e35 Satami\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nMisty's Starmie\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Smash Bros. series\n\n\nGames:\n\nSuper Smash Bros. \u2022 Super Smash Bros.
