There is a single green leaf on each side of its body. It has a yellow bell-shaped head with what appear to be pink lips at the end and beady black eyes. It is capable of spitting corrosive acid from its mouth. Its stem is long, thin and very flexible, making it capable of swerving rapidly to avoid many attacks or moving with blinding speed to capture prey. Its roots resemble feet, and it uses them as such.\nIt will plant its roots in the ground to replenish water, but it is unable to flee while it is rooted. Bellsprout prefers hot and humid places, thus it lives in temperate forests and jungles. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Bellsprout is known to sleep while planting its roots deep in the ground.[1] Because Bellsprout feels so safe while sleeping, it tends to forget that it may need to run from danger.\n\nEvolution\nBellsprout evolves into Weepinbell, which evolves into Victreebel.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nBellsprout\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nWeepinbell\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nVictreebel\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nNPC appearances\nPok\u00e9mon Pinball: A Bellsprout appears on the Red Table, when the pinball can be shot into the Bellsprout, Catch'em Mode is activated allowing for the capture of a Pok\u00e9mon.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: A Bellsprout hangs around Pok\u00e9mon Square.\nPok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness: Bellsprout is the leader of the Team Flame, although he cannot touch the flames himself due to being a Grass-type.\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #069\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nA carnivorous Pok\u00e9mon that traps and eats bugs.
