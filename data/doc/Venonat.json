The fur releases a toxic liquid and it spreads when shaken violently off their bodies. A pink pincer-like mouth with two teeth, stubby forepaws, and a pair of two-toed feet are visible through its fur. Its limbs are light tan. There is also a pair of white antennae sprouting from the top of its head. However, the most prominent feature on its face are its large, red compound eyes. Venonat's highly developed eyes act as radar units and can shoot powerful beams.\nVenonat can be found in dense temperate forests, where it will sleep in the hole of a tree until nightfall. It sleeps throughout the day because the small insects it feeds on appear only at night. Both Venonat and its prey are attracted to bright lights.\n\n\n\n\n\nVenonat using its \"Radar Eye\" to find Team Rocket's truck\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenonat shooting an energy beam from its eyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution\nVenonat evolves into Venomoth.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nVenonat\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nVenomoth\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #048\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nLives in the shadows of tall trees where it eats insects.
