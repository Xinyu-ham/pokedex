Kakuna has a dome-shaped head and black, triangular eyes with glowing white pupils. It has two scythe-like arms in the middle of its body. When it comes close to evolving, its body gives off heat that makes it warm to the touch. Kakuna remains virtually immobile and waits for evolution, often hanging from tree branches by long strands of silk. When attacked, however, it can extend its poison barbs. Kakuna nests in temperate forests and misty wooded areas. Occasionally, it will also nest at the mouth of tunnels and caves, as seen in Pok\u00e9mon Snap.\n\nEvolution\nKakuna evolves from Weedle and evolves into Beedrill.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nWeedle\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nKakuna\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nBeedrill\u00a0Bug\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #014\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nAlmost incapable of moving, this Pok\u00e9mon can only harden its shell to protect itself from predators.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nAble to move only slightly.

Check! Friends? Check!.\nGoh caught a Kakuna in Battle Frontier Challenge: The Flute Cup!, just like he does in the animated series.\n\nIn the TCG\nMain article: Kakuna (TCG)\nTrivia\nKakuna shares its category with Metapod, Silcoon, and Cascoon. They are all known as the Cocoon Pok\u00e9mon.\nThey also share the same base stat total, move learnset, Ability, and EV yield.\nThis ties them as the evolved Pok\u00e9mon with the lowest base stat total.\nKakuna has the lowest base Attack stat of all Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue beta, \"Kokoon\" was the prototype English name for Kakuna. This is similar to its romanized Japanese name.\nKakuna's English name resembles a Japanese name, translating perfectly into \"\u30ab\u30af\u30ca\", than its actual Japanese name, Cocoon.\nIn Pok\u00e9mon the Series, Kakuna is explicitly shown evolving more than any other Pok\u00e9mon.[clarification needed]\nKakuna and its evolved form, Beedrill, are the only yellow Poison-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nDesign variations\n Kakuna's arms extended in Ken Sugimori artwork\nThe \"arms\" on Kakuna seen in its Red and Blue sprite are commonly mistaken to be a sprite error, as they are rarely shown in any other media. They have so far only been shown on its Red and Blue sprite and a Pocket Monsters Bandai card.\n\nConcept and development\nKakuna and its evolutionary relatives were designed by Atsuko Nishida.[1]\n\nOrigin\nKakuna appears to be based on the pupal stage of a bee or wasp. Its tendency to dangle from a thread (as seen in the animated series and some spin-off games) may also be based on certain parasitoid wasps whose larvae construct hanging cocoons.\n\nName origin\nKakuna may be a corruption of cocoon.\nCocoon is literally cocoon.\n\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30b3\u30af\u30fc\u30f3 Cocoon\n\nFrom cocoon\n\n\n French\n\nCoconfort\n\nFrom cocon, confort, and fort\n\n\n Spanish\n\nKakuna\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nKokuna\n\nFrom Kokon\n\n\n Italian\n\nKakuna\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ub531\ucda9\uc774 Ttakchungi\n\nFrom \ub531\ub531\ud558\ub2e4 ttakttakhada, \ucda9 chung and \uc774 i\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u9435\u6bbc\u86f9 / \u94c1\u58f3\u86f9 Ti\u011bk\u00e9y\u01d2ng*\u9435\u6bbc\u6606 / \u94c1\u58f3\u6606 Ti\u011bk\u00e9k\u016bn*\n\nFrom \u9435 / \u94c1 ti\u011b, \u6bbc / \u58f3 k\u00e9, and \u86f9 y\u01d2ngFrom \u9435 / \u94c1 ti\u011b, \u6bbc / \u58f3 k\u00e9 / qi\u00e0o, and \u6606\u87f2 k\u016bnch\u00f3ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u9435\u6bbc\u86f9 Tithoky\u00fang\n\nFrom \u9435 tit, \u6bbc hok, and \u86f9 y\u00fang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Danish\n\nPuppe *\n\nLiterally Cocoon\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05e7\u05d0\u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 Kakuna\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0915\u0915\u0942\u0928\u093e Kakuna\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nKakuna\n\nSame as English\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u041a\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043d\u0430 Kakuna\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e42\u0e04\u0e04\u0e39\u0e19 Khokhun\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nGiovanni's Kakuna\nReferences\n\n\u2191 Interview with Atsuko Nishida on Game Freak's website\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2190\n\n\n\n#0013: Weedle\n\n\n\n\n\nPok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n#0015: Beedrill\n\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Pok\u00e9mon article is part of Project Pok\u00e9dex, a Bulbapedia project that aims to write comprehensive articles on each Pok\u00e9mon species, as well as Pok\u00e9mon groups and forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/w/index.php?title=Kakuna_(Pok\u00e9mon)&oldid=4139802\"\nCategories: Pok\u00e9monGeneration I Pok\u00e9monBug-type Pok\u00e9monPoison-type Pok\u00e9monDual-type Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon with a gender ratio of one male to one femalePok\u00e9mon without Hidden AbilitiesPok\u00e9mon in the Medium Fast experience groupYellow-colored Pok\u00e9monBody style 02 Pok\u00e9monBug group Pok\u00e9monPok\u00e9mon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary linePok\u00e9mon in the Kanto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Johto Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon in the Kalos Pok\u00e9dexPok\u00e9mon with wild held itemsPok\u00e9mon with a base stat total of 205Pok\u00e9mon whose Special stat became both Special Attack and Special DefensePok\u00e9mon with 15 max performance starsPok\u00e9mon that cannot learn TMsBody size 1 Pok\u00e9mon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\nPage actions\n\n\nArticleDiscussionReadView sourceHistory\n\n\n\n\nPage actions\n\nArticleDiscussionMoreToolsIn other languages\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\nCreate accountLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\nMain PageEditor's HubHelpFrequently asked questionsBulbawiki forumRecent changesRandom page\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n \n\n\n\nBulbagarden\n\nBulbagarden home pageBulbagarden ArchivesBulbagarden ForumsBulbagarden Discord serverTwitchYouTubeFacebookMastodonTwitterTumblr\n\n\n\nTools\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload fileSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage informationCite this page\n\n\n\nIn other languages\n\nDeutschEspa\u00f1olFran\u00e7aisItaliano\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u4e2d\u6587\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 5 October 2024, at 02:58.Content is available under Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5.
