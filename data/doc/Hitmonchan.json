There are five blunt protrusions on top of its head, and it has structures resembling pads over its shoulders. It appears to be wearing a light purple tunic and kilt, as well as red boxing gloves and light purple boxing shoes. The gloves are actually masses of muscle. In between the tunic and kilt is a small, black area.\nAs its appearance suggests, Hitmonchan specializes in punching. It can throw punches that are too quick to be seen with the naked eye. Its punches are said to be as fast as a bullet train. It starts attacking foes with combo punches from both sides before finishing with a single straight punch. A single straight punch by Hitmonchan can launch foes over 300 mph. By punching with a corkscrew motion, it is even capable of drilling through concrete. Even a light graze from its punches will result in a burn. However, Hitmonchan requires a break every three minutes while fighting. Despite the need for frequent breaks, it has an unwavering spirit and will never give up in a difficult situation. Usually found in urban areas, it is rarely seen in the wild. It often competes with Hitmonlee and Hitmontop.\nIn Generation II, Mach Punch was its signature move, but Tyrogue could still inherit it via breeding. Prior to Generation V, Iron Fist was Hitmonchan's signature Ability.\n\nEvolution\nHitmonchan evolves from Tyrogue.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nTyrogue\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nHitmonchan\u00a0Fighting\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #107\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nWhile apparently doing nothing, it fires punches in lightning fast volleys that are impossible to see.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nPunches in corkscrew fashion.

The colors of Hitmonchan's gloves in its normal and Shiny colorations might be a reference to the red corner and blue corner in boxing. Its Gold, HeartGold, Generation V, and X Pok\u00e9dex entries mention that it needs a short break after fighting for three minutes, which is a reference to the duration of rounds in boxing.\n\nName origin\nHitmonchan is named after Jackie Chan[1] and may additionally involve a combination of hit and monster. The name is also related to Tyrogue's other evolutions, Hitmonlee and Hitmontop.\nEbiwalar may be derived from the Japanese world champion boxer Hiroyuki Ebihara.\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30a8\u30d3\u30ef\u30e9\u30fc Ebiwalar\n\nFrom Japanese boxer \u6d77\u8001\u539f\u535a\u5e78 Hiroyuki Ebihara\n\n\n French\n\nTygnon\n\nFrom Mike Tyson and gnon\n\n\n Spanish\n\nHitmonchan\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nNockchan\n\nFrom knock and Jackie Chan\n\n\n Italian\n\nHitmonchan\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\ud64d\uc218\ubaac Hongsoomon\n\nFrom Korean boxer \ud64d\uc218\ud658 Hong Soo-hwan and monster\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5feb\u62f3\u90ce Ku\u00e0iqu\u00e1nl\u00e1ng*\u827e\u6bd4\u90ce \u00c0ib\u01d0l\u00e1ng*\n\nFrom \u5feb\u62f3 ku\u00e0iqu\u00e1n and \u90ce l\u00e1ngFrom the partial transcription of its Japanese name and \u90ce l\u00e1ng\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5feb\u62f3\u90ce Faaiky\u00f9hnl\u00f2hng*\u6bd4\u83ef\u62c9 B\u00e9iwahl\u0101ai*\n\nFrom \u5feb\u62f3 faaiky\u00f9hn and \u90ce l\u00f2hngPartial transcription of its Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0915\u093e\u091f\u0948\u0915 Mukkattack\n\nFrom \u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0915\u093e mukka and attack\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0425\u0438\u0442\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0430\u043d Khitmonchan\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e34\u0e27\u0e32\u0e25\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c Ebiwala\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated articles\nMonlee\nGiovanni's Hitmonchan\nHitmons\nReferences\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Dockery, Daniel (October 4, 2022).
