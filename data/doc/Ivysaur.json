On top of its head are pointed ears with black insides, and it has narrow red eyes. Ivysaur has a short, rounded snout with a wide mouth and two pointed teeth in its upper jaw. Each of its feet has three claws on them. The bulb on its back has bloomed into a giant pink bud. A short brown trunk surrounded by leafy green fronds supports the bud.\nThe weight of the plant prevents Ivysaur from running fast and standing on its hind legs, forcing its legs to grow sturdy. When its flower is ready to bloom, it gives off a distinct, sweet-smelling aroma and starts swelling. Ivysaur will also start spending more time in sunlight in preparation for its upcoming evolution. Exposure to sunlight adds to the strength of both Ivysaur and its plant. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Ivysaur is known to sleep in sunny spots while undergoing its photosynthesis process. Researchers cannot decide if Ivysaur is awake or asleep during this process. Ivysaur are typically found in plains.\n\nEvolution\nIvysaur evolves from Bulbasaur and evolves into Venusaur.\n(For specifics on this Pok\u00e9mon's Evolution in the games, refer to Game data\u2192Evolution data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnevolved\n\n\nBulbasaur\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Evolution\n\n\nIvysaur\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Evolution\n\n\nVenusaur\u00a0Grass\u00a0\u00a0Poison\u00a0\n\n\n\nGame data\nPok\u00e9dex entries\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneration I\n\n\n\n\n\nKanto #002\n\n\n\n\n\nRed(JPN)\n\n(This entry was originally untranslated in English until it was reused in Pok\u00e9mon FireRed.)\n\n\nGreen\n\n\nRed(ENG)\n\nWhen the bulb on its back grows large, it appears to lose the ability to stand on its hind legs.\n\n\nBlue\n\n\nYellow \n\nThe bulb on its back grows by drawing energy.

Ultimate\n Ivysaur from Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\nIvysaur appears once again as a playable Pok\u00e9mon fighter used by the Pok\u00e9mon Trainer.\n\n\nTrivia\nIvysaur's evolutionary line is the only first partner Pok\u00e9mon evolutionary line to be Poison-type.\nIvysaur's evolutionary line is also the only first partner Pok\u00e9mon evolutionary line to have each member appear at least once in the Super Smash Bros. series.\nIn addition, Ivysaur is the only Pok\u00e9mon in the Super Smash Bros. series that Pok\u00e9mon Trainer uses that does not know an HM move; Squirtle uses Waterfall, while Charizard uses Rock Smash and Fly.\nIvysaur's numbers in the National Pok\u00e9dex and the Fiore Browser are the same: 002.\nIvysaur is the only second stage form of a dual-type Grass/Poison Pok\u00e9mon that does not require an Evolution stone to reach its final form.\nIvysaur is also the only second stage form of Kanto first partner Pok\u00e9mon that evolves at level 32. Charmeleon and Wartortle evolve at level 36.\nDue to the censor that prevents Pok\u00e9mon with offensive nicknames being traded on the GTS, an Ivysaur with an English name couldn't be traded on the GTS without a nickname in Pok\u00e9mon Black and White prior to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection's shutdown.\nIvysaur shares its category with its evolutionary relatives and Sunkern. They are all known as the Seed Pok\u00e9mon.\nIvysaur is never seen losing a battle on-screen in any animated media.\nOrigin\nIvysaur's evolutionary line is inspired by frogs.[1] In particular, its short legs, stout appearance, and ear-like protrusions on its head make it resemble horned frogs. Of its evolutionary line, Ivysaur was the first to be created, years before Bulbasaur, Venusaur or the concept of evolution was conceived, as it was one of the original monsters created for the Capsule Monsters pitch.[2] Venusaur and Bulbasaur's designs were created afterward; the latter was created by Atsuko Nishida by basing it off of Venusaur.[1]\nThe bud on its back resembles a Rafflesia flower, and the leaves around the bud resemble palms.\n\nName origin\nIvysaur may be a combination of ivy (woody climbing or trailing plant genus) and dinosaur, and may also incorporate poison ivy (referring to its Grass/Poison-type designation).\nFushigisou may be a combination of \u4e0d\u601d\u8b70 fushigi (strange; mysterious) and \u8349 s\u014d (grass), as well as a pun of the phrase \u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u305d\u3046 Fushigi s\u014d (\"It seems strange\").\n\nIn other languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\nTitle\n\nMeaning\n\n\n Japanese\n\n\u30d5\u30b7\u30ae\u30bd\u30a6 Fushigisou\n\nFrom \u4e0d\u601d\u8b70 fushigi and \u8349 s\u014d, as well as a pun of \u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u305d\u3046 Fushigi s\u014d\n\n\n French\n\nHerbizarre\n\nFrom herbe and bizarre, as well as a pun of air bizarre\n\n\n Spanish\n\nIvysaur\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n German\n\nBisaknosp\n\nFrom bizarr, Saurier, and Knospe\n\n\n Italian\n\nIvysaur\n\nSame as English name\n\n\n Korean\n\n\uc774\uc0c1\ud574\ud480 Isanghepul\n\nFrom \uc774\uc0c1\ud558\ub2e4 isanghada and \ud480 pul\n\n\n Mandarin Chinese\n\n\u5999\u86d9\u8349 Mi\u00e0ow\u0101c\u01ceo\n\nFrom \u5999 mi\u00e0o, \u86d9 w\u0101, and \u8349 c\u01ceo\n\n\n Cantonese Chinese\n\n\u5999\u86d9\u8349 Miuhw\u0101ch\u00f3u*\u5947\u7570\u8349 K\u00e8ihyihch\u00f3u*\n\nFrom \u5999 miuh, \u86d9 w\u0101, and \u8349 ch\u00f3uFrom \u5947\u7570 k\u00e8ihyih and \u8349 ch\u00f3u\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore languages\n\n\n Bulgarian\n\n\u0410\u0439\u0432\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0440 Ayvizor\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hebrew\n\n\u05d0\u05d9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d9\u05d6\u05d5\u05e8 Ayviyzor\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Hindi\n\n\u0906\u0907\u0935\u0940\u0938\u0949\u0930 Ivysaur\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Lithuanian\n\nAvizauras\n\nFrom English name\n\n\n Brazilian Portuguese\n\nIvyssauro\n\nFrom ivy and dinossauro\n\n\n Russian\n\n\u0410\u0439\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0440 Ayvizavr\n\nTranscription of English name\n\n\n Thai\n\n\u0e1f\u0e38\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e01\u0e34\u0e42\u0e0b Fuchikiso\n\nTranscription of Japanese name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also\nSaur\nMay's Ivysaur\nShauna's Ivysaur\nPok\u00e9mon Trainer (Super Smash Bros.)\nVenusaur (UNITE)\nFirst partner Pok\u00e9mon\nReferences\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Creator Profile: The Creators of Pikachu - Pok\u00e9mon.com (archived)\n\n\u2191 Prerelease:Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue - The Cutting Room Floor\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Smash Bros. series\n\n\nGames:\n\nSuper Smash Bros. \u2022 Super Smash Bros.
